As the Germans came marching into Pomtsburg he lead the resistance with bravery and determination. Pomtsburg was his birthplace and no one were to destroy it. The Battle of Pomtsburg never reached the history books, and few even remember how it ended. But the boy managed to steal this souvenir. Something to remind him and others that you shall always stand up to oppression.</string>
<string id="bm_msk_wmp_03_desc">This pilotka was found on a corpse near Lake Müritz in Germany. It was attached with a string around the poor, dead soldier's head. There were no other bodies next to unnamed fellow, and as the origin of the pilotka was russian, it's fair to assume that he stemmed from the same country. Speculations were many, none were true, but the most inspiring story was the one about a soldier so proud of the motherland that he tied his pilotka to his head before he died.</string>

<string id="bm_paycheck_chains_desc">Paycheck Chains longs to be completely bonkers. But truth to be told, behind that mask he's just a regular guy trying to make an indecent living. When trying to push his normal self into craziness, he took a poodle hostage during a robbery when a police showed up. What crazy person would do that, right? But he picked the wrong vicious mongrel to mess with. The dog ended up biting everyone in the crew before they managed to escape the beast. News report after the robbery claimed the dog showed symptoms of rabies. Maybe Paycheck Chains will finally become as crazy as he wants to be...</string>
<string id="bm_paycheck_dallas_desc">Paycheck Dallas finally made the decision to stop using black plastic bags for concealment. He gathered the nerve to order a real Dallas-mask to honor his idol, but that online printing service didn't exactly deliver the real deal... Even so, with the mask, he's trying to step up his game and convinced the Paycheck gang to raid a china shop. The CCTV footage shows that Paycheck Dallas accidentally broke the biggest vase while storming in. That made him apologize to the owner, grab all small changes from register and run for the door.  Probably blushing like a tomato behind that smiling neon mask.</string>
