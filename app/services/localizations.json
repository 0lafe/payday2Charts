Congratulations; You have taken your first step into a larger world.$NL;$NL;Let's have a look at the basic functions of Crime.net. Don't worry if it seems complex at first, everything is more or less self-explanatory.$NL;$NL;» CRIME.NET$NL;This is where you find new jobs, hook up with other crews, learn more about your contacts, and, occasionally, gamble away some of your hard earned off-shore funds.$NL;$NL;» HOSTING A CONTRACT$NL;Jobs with a timer are for you to host. Once the timer reaches zero, that contract will disappear and Crime.net will spawn another. A note on hosting: you are in charge of the contract, and you are responsible for your crew. $NL;$NL;If you drop out, the whole crew loses. Try and keep everyone alive, and make sure everyone makes it to the PAYDAY.$NL;$NL;» JOINING A CONTRACT$NL;Jobs that someone else is hosting have an icon with four men on them instead of a timer. The host's name is diplayed in blue, or green if it's a friend. You can join the crew as long as there is at least one empty slot.$NL;$NL;» DIFFICULTY$NL;Difficulty is rated from zero to four skulls. The more skulls, the harder it is. If this is your first time, pick a no-skull job. Trust me. Four skulls is what we call a Death Wish, and you shouldn't even attempt this until you are at least level 50.$NL;$NL;» REWARDS$NL;Successfully completing a contract will earn you cash and experience. Roll over a contract marker to see what the base payout is. Your final payday may be a lot bigger though; there are bonuses for risk, and you may be able to score additional funds during the heist. Remember: anything you can get your hands on is profit.$NL;$NL;The money and EXP is awarded after each day of the contract is completed. $NL;$NL;Once you've completed the entire contract, you'll also get what we call a PAYDAY: you get to draw a card to unlock a random item. This is how you score rare masks, weapon mods and other useful things. $NL;$NL;» CONTRACT LENGTH$NL;Jobs have different length. Start out doing a few 1 one day jobs before you move on to the longer heists. The EXP reward scales to your level, so there's no reason to kill yourself on a job that's too big for you at the start.$NL;$NL;$NL;THE SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX STUFF$NL;$NL;» PRO JOBS$NL;Some jobs have a red outline and 'PRO' label. Pro jobs give a bigger pay and more XP than normal jobs. If you fail however, you don't get to retry. Bear this in mind if you are attempting a multi-day heist.$NL;$NL;» STEALTH$NL;If you see a small ghost icon next to a contract marker, that means it's possible to complete the job without raising the alarm. Doing a job in stealth will net you an EXP bonus, which applies to any contract you take on immediately afterwards. A word of advice: If you're new to this, don't worry about stealth just yet. It  takes a tight crew with some serious skills to pull off a clean stealth job.$NL;$NL;» THE BOOST SYSTEM$NL;If you do the same job repeatedly, the EXP return will start to drop on that particular contract, and it will be boosted on others. The trick of maximising your EXP is to do a wide range of jobs. Boost is displayed with minus signs and a red glow for reduced EXP; and plus signs and an orange glow for increased EXP.$NL;$NL;» CONTRACT BROKER$NL;Once you get some cash together and start to level up, you can visit the contract broker and pick which jobs you want to do. Again, if this is your first time, just run with the offered contracts for now.$NL;$NL;TL;DR:$NL;Use Crime.net to find jobs and make money for that epic PAYDAY.$NL;$NL;This is all you need to know for now. Once you've climbed a few rungs on the criminal ladder, I'll drop you another note and talk you through some of the more complex stuff.

Only one can be active at any given time. Perk Points are converted from gained EXP points, and you'll keep gaining EXP even after hitting the level cap.$NL;$NL;To gain a perk, simply click and hold the + icon in the perk deck that you want to level up.

Congratulations; You have taken your first step into a larger world.$NL;$NL;Let's have a look at the basic functions of Crime.net. Don't worry if it seems complex at first, everything is more or less self-explanatory.$NL;$NL;» CRIME.NET$NL;This is where you find new jobs, hook up with other crews, learn more about your contacts, and, occasionally, gamble away some of your hard earned off-shore funds.$NL;$NL;» HOSTING A CONTRACT$NL;Jobs with a timer are for you to host. Once the timer reaches zero, that contract will disappear and Crime.net will spawn another. A note on hosting: you are in charge of the contract, and you are responsible for your crew. $NL;$NL;If you drop out, the whole crew loses. Try and keep everyone alive, and make sure everyone makes it to the PAYDAY.$NL;$NL;» JOINING A CONTRACT$NL;Jobs that someone else is hosting have an icon with four men on them instead of a timer. The host's name is diplayed in blue, or green if it's a friend. You can join the crew as long as there is at least one empty slot.$NL;$NL;» DIFFICULTY$NL;Difficulty is rated from zero to four skulls. The more skulls, the harder it is. If this is your first time, pick a no-skull job. Trust me. Four skulls is what we call a Death Wish, and you shouldn't even attempt this until you are at least level 50.$NL;$NL;» REWARDS$NL;Successfully completing a contract will earn you cash and experience. Roll over a contract marker to see what the base payout is. Your final payday may be a lot bigger though; there are bonuses for risk, and you may be able to score additional funds during the heist. Remember: anything you can get your hands on is profit.$NL;$NL;The money and EXP is awarded after each day of the contract is completed. $NL;$NL;Once you've completed the entire contract, you'll also get what we call a PAYDAY: you get to draw a card to unlock a random item. This is how you score rare masks, weapon mods and other useful things. $NL;$NL;» CONTRACT LENGTH$NL;Jobs have different length. Start out doing a few 1 one day jobs before you move on to the longer heists. The EXP reward scales to your level, so there's no reason to kill yourself on a job that's too big for you at the start.$NL;$NL;$NL;THE SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX STUFF$NL;$NL;» PRO JOBS$NL;Some jobs have a red outline and 'PRO' label. Pro jobs give a bigger pay and more XP than normal jobs. If you fail however, you don't get to retry. Bear this in mind if you are attempting a multi-day heist.$NL;$NL;» STEALTH$NL;If you see a small ghost icon next to a contract marker, that means it's possible to complete the job without raising the alarm. Doing a job in stealth will net you an EXP bonus, which applies to any contract you take on immediately afterwards. A word of advice: If you're new to this, don't worry about stealth just yet. It  takes a tight crew with some serious skills to pull off a clean stealth job.$NL;$NL;» THE BOOST SYSTEM$NL;If you do the same job repeatedly, the EXP return will start to drop on that particular contract, and it will be boosted on others. The trick of maximising your EXP is to do a wide range of jobs. Boost is displayed with minus signs and a red glow for reduced EXP; and plus signs and an orange glow for increased EXP.$NL;$NL;» CONTRACT BROKER$NL;Once you get some cash together and start to level up, you can visit the contract broker and pick which jobs you want to do. Again, if this is your first time, just run with the offered contracts for now.$NL;$NL;TL;DR:$NL;Use Crime.net to find jobs and make money for that epic PAYDAY.$NL;$NL;This is all you need to know for now. Once you've climbed a few rungs on the criminal ladder, I'll drop you another note and talk you through some of the more complex stuff.

Congratulations; You have taken your first step into a larger world.$NL;$NL;Let's have a look at the basic functions of Crime.net. Don't worry if it seems complex at first, everything is more or less self-explanatory.$NL;$NL;» CRIME.NET$NL;This is where you find new jobs, hook up with other crews, learn more about your contacts, and, occasionally, gamble away some of your hard earned off-shore funds.$NL;$NL;» HOSTING A CONTRACT$NL;Jobs with a timer are for you to host. Once the timer reaches zero, that contract will disappear and Crime.net will spawn another. A note on hosting: you are in charge of the contract, and you are responsible for your crew. $NL;$NL;If you drop out, the whole crew loses. Try and keep everyone alive, and make sure everyone makes it to the PAYDAY.$NL;$NL;» JOINING A CONTRACT$NL;Jobs that someone else is hosting have an icon with four men on them instead of a timer. The host's name is diplayed in blue, or green if it's a friend. You can join the crew as long as there is at least one empty slot.$NL;$NL;» DIFFICULTY$NL;Difficulty is rated from zero to four skulls. The more skulls, the harder it is. If this is your first time, pick a no-skull job. Trust me. Four skulls is what we call a Death Wish, and you shouldn't even attempt this until you are at least level 50.$NL;$NL;» REWARDS$NL;Successfully completing a contract will earn you cash and experience. Roll over a contract marker to see what the base payout is. Your final payday may be a lot bigger though; there are bonuses for risk, and you may be able to score additional funds during the heist. Remember: anything you can get your hands on is profit.$NL;$NL;The money and EXP is awarded after each day of the contract is completed. $NL;$NL;Once you've completed the entire contract, you'll also get what we call a PAYDAY: you get to draw a card to unlock a random item. This is how you score rare masks, weapon mods and other useful things. $NL;$NL;» CONTRACT LENGTH$NL;Jobs have different length. Start out doing a few 1 one day jobs before you move on to the longer heists. The EXP reward scales to your level, so there's no reason to kill yourself on a job that's too big for you at the start.$NL;$NL;$NL;THE SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX STUFF$NL;$NL;» FILTERS$NL;There are several filters available to tweak what Crime.net displays. Examples: Look for friends only, widen your search, look for a particular job. Hopefully self-explanatory.$NL;$NL;» STEALTH$NL;If you see a small ghost icon next to a contract marker, that means it's possible to complete the job without raising the alarm. Doing a job in stealth will net you an EXP bonus, which applies to any contract you take on immediately afterwards. A word of advice: If you're new to this, don't worry about stealth just yet. It  takes a tight crew with some serious skills to pull off a clean stealth job.$NL;$NL;» THE BOOST SYSTEM$NL;If you do the same job repeatedly, the EXP return will start to drop on that particular contract, and it will be boosted on others.

Stop them!","loc_skm_28_02":"There you you go, well done. We squished those kerels for every last penny.

Nice work!","loc_skm_end_fail":"Blerrie, that didn't go the way I planned. A kakspul of trouble it was.

You need to redo the hack.","loc_tag_12_02":"Time to find Garrett's office, friends. Have a little fun with the guy.","loc_tag_13_02":"Come on friends, we have a schedule to keep.","loc_tag_14_02":"These Federal Kerels have got more interesting things than donuts and pie lying around- things we could get a pretty penny for to keep us going, so if you see something nice, go ahead and rop it.

Commissioner Garrett has arrested the Elephant on trumped-up charges in order to get an item he has, that the owners of Murkywater- these Kataru people, want. He's making a deal to give it to them in exchange for what we can only guess is the body of Bain, now that they're done with him. The item obviously very important for them to risk exposing themselves and I wouldn't bet against the whole thing being about Bain's Grail-Dinges. We don't know yet what the Elephant's doing in all of this, if he's still solid with us, and we couldn't help him right now even if we wanted to, but Garrett will be in his FBI headquarters tonight preparing for the exchange, so we're going to ruin his plans.","loc_tag_end_01":"Well done, friends. We pulled the rug from right under Commissioner Garrett and I expect his next few hours won't be very pleasant. Oh, to be there when he goes to his meeting empty-handed, yeah? Bain would be proud. As soon as you get back to the safehouse, Duke should get cracking on examining the Elephant's box. We've got to know how it connects to the one you acquired in Las Vegas, to Bain's grail-dinges and these Kataru chops. Then we plan our next move.","loc_tag_intro_01b":"I'm impressed Hoxton isn't having a nervous breakdown coming back to this place.","loc_tag_intro_02h":"Fuck this, why are we talking about donuts?

The Murkys have gone bossies!","loc_vit_112_01":"With any luck, the Murkys will not follow you. This tunnel is said to be able to withstand a couple nukes.

See if you can find something. Turn the room upside down if you have to.","loc_vit_38_01":"There you go! That has to be important.","loc_vit_40_02":"That corridor isn't short, is it. Built to take a couple nukes, it was.","loc_vit_40_03":"You gotta wonder, if the nukes were dropping, would you really want to have to go this far to get to the PEOC?","loc_vit_42_02":"You've seen that model before. Hard to break.","loc_vit_43_01":"I've got an idea. We hack the mainframe.

Patch me into it.","loc_vit_45_01":"Alright, I'm in.

Just need a little while.","loc_vit_81_01":"Don't let the enemies interrupt the hack.","loc_vit_82_01":"They interrupted the hacking device.

Outstanding work!","pln_bb1_end_01_02":"This is a historic day, gang. Haha, you finally cracked the Benevolent.","pln_bb1_end_03_02":"You just ensured yourselves a place in the history books, gang. Simply outstanding!","pln_bb1_end_04_02":"(sings) \"They're the gang that broke the bank at Monte Carlo\".

They saw you!","pln_bigoil_stage1_18_any_01":"Nice, bring the money to the van.","pln_bigoil_stage2_03_any_01":"You can use the keycard you found.","pln_bigoil_stage2_04_any_01":"Good, now set up the connection.","pln_bigoil_stage2_12_any_01":"Alright, looks like we have... 11... 12 prototypes. See if you can find something around the house that can indicate which is the working one. Then pick it up and get it to me.","pln_bigoil_stage2_20_any_02":"This one seems to be malfunctioning, I'll be back to pick up another one.","pln_bigoil_stage2_21_any_01":"Nice work guys! This seems to be the right one! You guys better head out of there ASAP.","pln_bo1_02_any_01":"OK guys, search the place. They have a safe somewhere, it's probably in there.","pln_bo1_08_any_01":"That might be useful.","pln_bo1_10_any_02":"Seems to be keys to an airplane.","pln_bo1_11_any_01":"Damn it! They've spotted you!","pln_bo1_16_any_01":"They've electrified the fence! Find a way around it!","pln_bo1_16_any_02":"Ouch - that sure drew attention.","pln_bo2_23_any_02":"Smack daddy in the middle. Alex dropped good.","pln_bo2_33_any_02":"OK, doctors - bring your MIT skills. Figure out which one is the correct fusion engine. Go!","pln_bo2_34_any_02":"Check his papers, notes and computers. Anything for a hint on what is correct here.","pln_bo2_37_any_02":"OK, chopper is here - get the engine loaded up.","pln_bo2_40_any_02":"He delivered the engine. I'll have my man here inspect it, and if it's the right one we're good to go. So hang tight for a sec.","pln_bo2_43_any_01":"Nice work guys! This seems to be the right one! You guys better head out of there ASAP. Use the plane keys you found.","pln_bo2_46_any_02":"OK, you delivered! Now let me get you out of there.","pln_bph_01_01":"Dentist, you asshole, I'm going to drill out those glowing eyes of yours...","pln_bph_05_02":"Hey guys. Been waitin' for ya.

Elephant... Sputnik... gotta warn...","pln_branchbank_cash_brf_speak_03":"Today's our lucky day - cash delivery from the airport to this bank, all sorts of denominations... So I propose we do a little money exchange of our own. ","pln_branchbank_cash_cnc_03":"Payday is this week which means the currency's here now. Which means we are too.","pln_branchbank_cash_cnc_06":"I'd feel bad about hitting another bank if they felt bad about hitting us. So I don't. Let's cash out.","pln_branchbank_cash_stage1_brief_02":"Just because this is a bank job for cash doesn't mean it's gonna be easy. You need to get into the bank vault, try to control the civilians and tellers so they don't hit the alarm.","pln_branchbank_cash_stage1_brief_02b":"The manager might have a key too. I'd wish you luck, but you don't need it, right? ","pln_branchbank_cash_stage1_intro_a_01":"OK, the thermal drill you need for the vault is somewhere in the parking lot. Get it before you do your takedown. Then you can go hit that vault. Watch for cameras and bank employees. Do your homework before you go in and remember cash is king.","pln_branchbank_depositbox_brf_speak_02b":"Let's get into that vault.","pln_branchbank_depositbox_stage1_intro_a_02":"OK people, my contact thoughtfully stashed the thermal drill you're going to need to crack the bank vault somewhere in the parking lot. Get it, then hit the bank vault.","pln_branchbank_gold_a_intro_a_05":"People I think this job is a gold mine. Almost literally.

I don't know what's here but I like our chances.","pln_branchbank_regular_a_intro_a_05":"This branch bank is ready for the taking. Let's do this.","pln_branchbank_stage1_05_any_01":"I love banks. The smell of all that money.","pln_branchbank_stage1_13_any_01":"Alright, bring it to the van, it's right across the street.","pln_branchbank_stage1_15_any_04":"Get that gold wrapped up!","pln_branchbank_stage1_23_any_03":"Guys let's keep things moving along here.","pln_branchbank_stage1_29_any_01":"OK! you've got enough...

Looking good.","pln_branchbank_stage1_34_any_03":"I like what I'm seeing in there.","pln_branchbank_stage1_42_any_01":"Loads of cash! Bag it up boys!","pln_branchbank_stage1_43_any_01":"Looks like we've hit the jackpot! Bag it up!","pln_branchbank_stage1_84_any_01":"OK, great. Now get that thing to the vault door.","pln_branchbank_stage1_end_a_01":"They had no chance at all. I don't think the National Guard could have stopped you.","pln_branchbank_stage1_end_a_02":"Loot's ours. One thing I like about bank jobs is the instant gratification. Good work.","pln_branchbank_stage1_end_a_03":"Safe house vault is going to be a little crowded tonight. Nicely done, folks.","pln_branchbank_stage1_end_a_12":"If there were more crews like you I think the world would need to store its valuables elsewhere.","pln_briefing_start_a_03":"People...","pln_briefing_start_b_05":"...This is the setup.","pln_brn_04_01":"Rust's bike isn't going to roll without an engine, and the mechanic said to check inside the clubhouse. Get a move on.","pln_brn_06_01":"The bikers are apparently storing stuff in an old bunker. The mechanic said you would find a seat for the bike in there.","pln_brn_06_02":"The mechanic told you to go to the bunker and get the seat for him. ","pln_brn_08_02":"Perfect, now deliver the part to the mechanic so he can work!","pln_brn_08_04":"You got what he asked for, now you need to bring it to him.","pln_brn_08_05":"That's the part he asked for. One step closer gang.","pln_brn_12_03":"Ride, boys and girls, ride!","pln_ca1_01_02":"Remember, you in civvie mode. That means no guns or masks. You're invisibles. Micho, our Inside Man here, left a guitar case with your gear somewhere.","pln_ca1_06_02":"That's them. Now scan them in, and fax me a copy. I'll figure out the right vent.","pln_ca1_100_02":"Now just grab that thing and get it out of there. It's what we came for.","pln_ca1_105_02":"A three digit code will open the armory. Find it.","pln_ca1_106_02":"Good job, we already have that code. Use it on the armory.","pln_ca1_109_02":"Crap! Just plant the C4 at the other spot. It's a sure thing now.","pln_ca1_111_02":"Light that flare, gang. Bile needs to drop off the winch.","pln_ca1_112_03":"Remember to sort the fireworks. Light up the night sky.","pln_ca1_117_02":"Will one of you clowns just grab that loot, please?","pln_ca1_119_02":"Great. Now toss it up onto BFD.","pln_ca1_121_02":"Now get onto BFD and let the blimp carry you up, up and away. Or stay and grab more loot.","pln_ca1_126_02":"Two!","pln_ca1_133_02":"Nine!","pln_ca1_134_03":"Gambling is a disease. Stop while you can, sucker!","pln_ca1_136_02":"This place is legit rich. Let's make it legit poor.","pln_ca1_137_03":"These machines are small fry. We're here for a bigger prize.","pln_ca1_138_02":"This is reception. Remember where it is.","pln_ca1_139_01":"This area's employees only. All the offices are accessible from here.","pln_ca1_139_03":"This is where the staff work. Offices, IT, security and so on.","pln_ca1_150_01":"Get the blueprints in the archives. They're somewhere in the employee only areas..","pln_ca1_151_03":"Gang. You gotta scan and fax over the blueprints. Sure that can be done in IT.","pln_ca1_157_02":"I think they saw that from the ISS!","pln_ca1_159_02":"Thank you for your time, sir.","pln_ca1_160_01":"This is, uh, Craig in the, uh, Customer Satisfaction Department calling.","pln_ca1_161_01":"I wanted to ask if you were thinking of trying our All You Can Eat buffet today?","pln_ca1_163_03":"If you want your beef rare, we'll just wipe its ass and lead it to your table.","pln_ca1_164_01":"We're serving... uh... soup. Made with... uh... vegetables.","pln_ca1_165_01":"We got ice cream too. You like ice cream?","pln_ca1_166_04":"And if you want, we can even make you toast.","pln_ca1_168_01":"You're wasting time! Repair BFD, get her working and let's finish this caper.","pln_ca1_16_02":"That's the list. Now get back to IT and upload it from an online terminal.","pln_ca1_172_02":"Get the winch hooked to BFD, gang.","pln_ca1_172_03":"You need to hook BFD up with the winch.","pln_ca1_173_02":"Armory needs a three digit code. You can find the digits throughout the Grin. Get to it!","pln_ca1_173_03":"We need a code to open the armory. Three digits. Colour coded. They're somewhere in the Grin. Get searching!","pln_ca1_18_01":"Looks like he's running dry. Bring him another with a little extra flavor in it. I'm sure you can find a bottle in one of the bars and spike it.","pln_ca1_23_03":"Pour him a drink. Once he takes a sip, the little something we added should... well, he's going to run for the nearest toilet. Follow him. Get his keycard.","pln_ca1_24_01":"That's it, buddy. Drink up.","pln_ca1_24_02":"Take a nice, long drink, pal.","pln_ca1_26_01":"Now look for a vent, and get the gas pumping. Send the security to Neverland.","pln_ca1_28_03":"Three digits. Outstanding! Now head to the vault and try them out.","pln_ca1_29_02":"Okay. Mask up when you're ready.","pln_ca1_31_03":"Dentist tells me they have C4 in the armory there. Get there, and get it.","pln_ca1_38_01":"Now plant the C4 in the main hall. The vault is right below. Two possible spots to blow. Hope lady luck is with us!","pln_ca1_38_02":"Now detonate the C4 in the main hall. Place it right above the vault. Hard to say exactly where that is. Two possible spots. Pray for a bit of luck.","pln_ca1_38_03":"Put the C4 in the main hall, right above the vault. Two possible spots, so it's a bit of a lottery. If need be, we'll blow them both!","pln_ca1_42_03":"Put the winch together where I marked, crew.","pln_ca1_44_01":"All right! Signal the blimp. And do it Vegas style. Find some fireworks and light them up.","pln_ca1_44_03":"We're going to bring the drill in with a blimp. For the pilot to see your signal, you need to set off a firework display. So look for them!","pln_ca1_45_02":"Great! Now head to the terrace and place the fireworks.","pln_ca1_52_01":"You need to get BFD right above the vault. The winch will move her, so get them hooked up.","pln_ca1_55_01":"All right, now let the winch do its job.","pln_ca1_56_02":"BFD is a greedy girl. Needs a lot of power. Hook her up to two sockets. You can find them inside the casino. And keep the cops off.","pln_ca1_59_03":"Okay, she's drilling down into the vault. You keep her safe.","pln_ca1_60_01":"Damn, cops got to her! Clear the zone and reactivate BFD!","pln_ca1_60_02":"The cops shut down BFD. Deal with them, and start her up again.","pln_ca1_61_01":"Water tanks are empty. Refill them in the bathrooms. Hey, I never promised you glamour.","pln_ca1_63_03":"BFD did a great job. Down into the vault. gang.","pln_ca1_66_02":"Maybe your gear is at the pool. See if Micho left the gear there. Look for a guitar case.","pln_ca1_70_01":"Still waiting on the guest list, guys. Get to reception and download it.","pln_ca1_72_02":"Find me the list, gang. Just plug it into an online terminal in IT.","pln_ca1_73_02":"That's him. Got his name, SSN, last time he took a dump... Check the screen in IT. Find him. Says here he loves the slots, so maybe that will be where he is.","pln_ca1_78_01":"Now! Tie him down.","pln_ca1_87_02":"That did it. They're all fast asleep. No need to worry about cameras from here on.","pln_ca1_91_02":"That's the first number. Keep looking. Two to go.","pln_ca1_94_02":"Outstanding! That's the vault code. Once we're in the Security Center, we can open the vault with it.","pln_ca1_97_02":"We got the pit boss' code. Nice.","pln_ca1_intro_02_01":"Let's rock!","pln_ca1_intro_02_02":"Arriving in style!","pln_can_01_02":"Guys, we can't risk leaving those thugs around. Deal with them.","pln_can_02_01":"Don't forget to find the elves. Shout at them to make them work.","pln_can_intro_03":"All right. The so-called toyshop. Just ahead.","pln_ce_01_02":"Getting pretty unpleasant out there. You guys sure you wanna stick around?","pln_ch1_05_02":"Find that storage room, gang. The keys will be there.","pln_ch1_06_02":"Locked. Damn it! Alright, stay cool. Find the manager. Take him hostage. I'm sure he can help us get in.","pln_ch1_07_01":"I'm looking at the manager's file. Chances are he's wearing a black suit.","pln_ch1_07_03":"I've accessed the manager's file. He'll be wearing a suit.","pln_ch1_08_03":"The manager's hair is thinning. That might narrow your search.","pln_ch1_11_01":"Use the manager's keycard to open his office.","pln_ch1_14_01":"I'm in. Need some time to open that lock. Instead of sitting there scratching your ass, head out to the van and get some C4. Time to prepare your escape.","pln_ch1_15_02":"Guys, grab the C4 from the van. Get it on the street.","pln_ch1_15_03":"Gang, the C4 is in the van. Get it, and plant it.","pln_ch1_18_03":"And... storage room is open. The keys are ready for you.","pln_ch1_19_01":"Get the car keys in the storage room!","pln_ch1_19_02":"Gang, you need to grab the car keys.","pln_ch1_22_01":"All of you need to be inside the dealership so I can blow up the C4!","pln_ch1_26_02":"Nearly got it.","pln_ch1_27_02":"Hope this is the right one.","pln_ch1_29_03":"Crap, wrong computer. Cops are incoming. You don't have much time now.","pln_ch1_33_01":"Alright, just park the car in that container, and walk away!","pln_ch1_35_01":"Nice, I'll detonate these. You just be ready with the cars.","pln_ch1_35_02":"Ok, I'll set these off remotely. You focus on the cars.","pln_ch1_35_03":"Great. Poppa Bain will take care of these. Now, back to the keys.","pln_ch1_end_01_03":"Great job! These beauties will be tearing up the streets of Eastern Europe in no time.","pln_chw_03_02":"You need to get to the front!","pln_chw_03_03":"Go forward and don't stop!","pln_chw_03_08":"We need to get our hands on the BCI tech, gang. Go forward!","pln_chw_04_03":"This car doesn't have a door, so you'll have to use a blowtorch to make one.","pln_chw_05_03":"Search all boxes you find. I won't risk missing the BCI tech because Rust's information was wrong.","pln_chw_06_03":"Holy...! They rigged the boxes with C4! Defuse them!","pln_chw_07_01":"I'm not taking any chances with these boxes. Search 'em.","pln_chw_08_02":"There it is! Get through the gate and secure both the BCI headset and the software.","pln_chw_08_03":"Oh yeah, there it is. Get the gate open and secure the BCI headset and the software.","pln_chw_09_01":"What are you waiting for? Get through that gate!","pln_chw_14_03":"I said it's time to go!","pln_chw_19_03":"You'll need to remove those barrels, and you need to do it fast. Just release the straps or something.","pln_chw_20_02":"Use the blowtorch to get through the gate!","pln_chw_21_01":"The door's locked. See if you can find another way out so we can keep going forward.","pln_chw_21_03":"The door appears to be locked from the outside. Look around and see if you can find another way to get out.","pln_cp1_02_01":"There he is! Wake him up and take him to a safe place. There's a lumber yard nearby. ","pln_cp1_02_02":"There's our guy. He's shit faced! Get him away from there. There's a deserted lumber yard near your position.","pln_cp1_03_02":"Jesus, he's wasted. Stay with him. He's in no shape to defend himself.","pln_cp1_05_02":"OK, that's the chopper you can hear. Get our guy out there.","pln_cp1_06_01":"Good work! Chopper's gonna drop him off then come back for the rest of you. While you're waiting, look around the forest for any more packages.","pln_cp1_08_01":"Chopper's headed out, but stay cool - it'll be back. Look for more loot in the forest. And stay safe.","pln_cp1_11_02":"The night's not so silent. Think I heard another present hit the ground. Find it!","pln_cp1_11_03":"Do my ears deceive me, or was that the sweet sound of another of Vlad's presents hitting the floor? Look for it!","pln_cp1_12_03":"Pilot is down! Get him back on his feet.","pln_cp1_13_01":"Oh man, the pilot just went down again. Wake that old wino up!","pln_cp1_13_02":"For crying out loud, the pilot has hit the deck again. Wake him up!","pln_cp1_15_01":"Chopper's headed for the crash site. Get ready!","pln_cp1_17_02":"Chopper will be at the antenna. Wait for it!","pln_cp1_20_02":"Chopper sees the flare. He's on his way. One minute.","pln_cr2_01_02":"Into the dockyard, gang. Keep an eye out for security and cameras. Go.","pln_cr2_02_03":"A keycard for the gate. Gonna need another, though.","pln_cr2_06_02":"Left panel's activated. Now get another keycard, and let's get the second panel done.","pln_cr2_08_02":"You thought you were just going to stroll in through the main entrance? Look around for another way in.","pln_cr2_09_01":"Great. Alright. Next step is to find two keycards. Most likely indoors.","pln_cr2_103_03":"Guards are down. Don't worry about the cameras now. ","pln_cr2_105_01":"Moretta will be moved to Dock 3B... Once you execute all the necessary steps.","pln_cr2_10_01":"Guys, you gotta get into the dockyard.","pln_cr2_118_03":"Dinner time, little fishies.","pln_cr2_119_02":"No one'll see that there.","pln_cr2_120_02":"Cops are at the powerboxes. Don't let them cut the juice.","pln_cr2_122_02":"Why're you still searching containers? You got the bomb!","pln_cr2_124_01":"The comm frequency ain't here. Alright, then check the terminals in the office across the dockyard.","pln_cr2_125_01":"That's our ship. The Moretta. But we can't get on it from here. You gotta move it to dock 3B.","pln_cr2_125_03":"The Moretta - That's our girl. But we can't get on board here. You have to see her moved to dock 3B.","pln_cr2_12_04":"Maybe the buildings are your best chance for finding keycards.","pln_cr2_19_02":"What's wrong with you? You have the frequencies!","pln_cr2_20_02":"Great job keeping it quiet. They don't suspect you, so the containers are unlocked. Have at it!","pln_cr2_21_02":"These frequencies will be useful later on. For now, though, stay focused on the job.","pln_cr2_23_01":"There, chopper dropped the bag. Go pick up the C4, guys.","pln_cr2_23_03":"OK, there's the C4. Help yourself!","pln_cr2_26_01":"Halfway there.","pln_cr2_27_02":"Just one more.","pln_cr2_28_03":"C4's all done. Now let's blow the gate.","pln_cr2_30_01":"Well, we're not getting the Captain's cooperation now, but we still need that ship moved. Just hack the ship control terminal and make sure it stays on.","pln_cr2_32_01":"They cut the power. Get it back on.","pln_cr2_33_01":"Good. I can get on with the work now.","pln_cr2_34_03":"Moretta is powering up. Let it move to its berth. Weapons free.","pln_cr2_35_02":"Moretta's at the berth. Time for a hostile boarding.","pln_cr2_39_01":"You can use the crowbar to open up shipping crates.","pln_cr2_39_03":"A crowbar. Good find. Always useful.","pln_cr2_40_03":"Gonna need to call the Moretta, and for that we need the comm frequencies. Search for it.","pln_cr2_42_01":"And here's the second control room for the gate.","pln_cr2_43_03":"The wagons on the train might be loaded. And might have loot. Check 'em out?","pln_cr2_44_02":"A keycard, but no damn good right now. Alarm's been sounded. Stay focused on the task.","pln_cr2_49_01":"Guys! Use the keycards in the dock control rooms. Get the dock gate open.","pln_cr2_49_02":"You can use those keycards in the control rooms. Just swipe 'em, open the dock.","pln_cr2_50_02":"Gate won't open with you standing on it, genius. Clear the area!","pln_cr2_51_01":"Alright, dock's opened. Now we gotta call the Moretta. Get her moving. Comm frequencies should be on one of the computers in the offices. Find it. I'll patch in and do the talking.","pln_cr2_51_02":"Nice! Dock is opening. Next step: get the Moretta moving to her berth. I need to talk to her directly. Find me the comm frequency - most likely on a computer in the offices there. Find it.","pln_cr2_52_01":"That's it. Dock gate's opened. Now let's get the ship moving. We have the comm frequency. Just find the radio and patch me in.","pln_cr2_52_02":"That's it for the gate. Now we just got to get the ship moving. That frequency you found earlier will do it. Find a radio and let me talk to the Moretta","pln_cr2_57_02":"I don't want to keep someone who calls herself the Butcher waiting. Get onto the ship!","pln_cr2_57_03":"Moretta is berthed and ready for you, clowns.","pln_cr2_58_02":"Come on, check those containers.","pln_cr2_60_01":"Nothing in here. Keep looking!","pln_cr2_60_02":"Empty! Move on.","pln_cr2_63_02":"Bingo! Now secure the bomb-parts.","pln_cr2_67_03":"You're keeping it quiet. Great. Remember - you need keycards.","pln_cr2_69_01":"Don't think anyone knows you're there. Now get the comm frequency.","pln_cr2_73_03":"They still don't know you're there. Get on the ship. Keep it quiet.","pln_cr2_75_02":"Now get out of there without triggering the alarm, and this is a perfect stealth job.","pln_cr2_78_01":"Place the C4 on the gate!","pln_cr2_79_01":"Get away from the gate! Fast!","pln_cr2_84_01":"Reactivate the computer, gang.","pln_cr2_85_01":"Don't let them get close to the power boxes.","pln_cr2_87_01":"Almost... Done. Just a moment now, guys.","pln_cr2_89_03":"Get your drills on those containers, clowns.","pln_cr2_91_02":"The van is your way out of there. Get to it!","pln_cr2_91_03":"Your escape driver's parked up.

We can shift that, make a little extra dollar.","pln_cr2_intro_01_02":"See that the ship gets out of the dock and berth. Then you can board it and get the explosives. Keep it quiet.","pln_cr2_intro_01_03":"You're gonna get that Croatian ship out of the dock and berth. Gonna try and keep the volume low.","pln_cr3_04_02":"OK, thermite's through. A chopper is bringing the water. Connect it when it arrives.","pln_cr3_06_01":"There's the hose! Connect it to the vault.","pln_cr3_08_02":"Boom!","pln_cr3_10_01":"There's the ladder and thermite. Grab 'em. You'll need them later.","pln_cr3_12_01":"Here's the ladder. You can use it to get on top of the wagons.","pln_cr3_12_02":"Great! You can use this ladder to get up on the wagons.","pln_cr3_13_02":"Use that ladder to climb onto the wagons.","pln_cr3_15_02":"There's the vault! Great! Now use the thermite on the top and burn your way through. ","pln_cr3_16_01":"Find a ladder. Then you can climb the wagons.","pln_cr3_26_02":"Get that hose re-attached!","pln_cr3_27_01":"The cops have disconnected the hose. Reconnect it!","pln_cr3_27_03":"Dammit! They yanked the hose. Get there, get it back on.","pln_cr3_28_02":"OK, chopper is back. Get pumping again!","pln_cr3_37_03":"That zip-line is your way out - get there!","pln_cr3_42_01":"The plane is close. Mark the landing strip with flares.","pln_cr3_43_01":"Great! Plane on approach now..","pln_cr3_49_01":"Briefcase with high-temperature thermite paste will be waiting for you here.","pln_cr3_50_01":"Industrial, high-pressure water pump used by nearby timber mill. If we're lucky, and the right wagon lands near it, we can use it to fill the vault.","pln_cr3_51_01":"Now dip that charge in and stand back!","pln_cr3_55_03":"All that wagon is waiting for is a nice bit of C4. Get to it!","pln_cs1_02_02":"You got one of the keycards, now find the other one.","pln_cs1_03_03":"Great, two keycards. That's what we need. Get to work and open that vault.","pln_cs1_05_01":"There it goes. The vault is open. It's all yours, gang. ","pln_cs1_06_01":"OK, great! Get that sack of cash to the van.","pln_cs1_06_03":"Beautiful stacks of unmarked Benjamins. Just reward for an honest heister.","pln_cs1_08_01":"Alright, that's our blackmailer dealt with. Let's hustle those other bags, before he gets greedy.","pln_cs1_08_03":"Well, easy money for him. Put it out of your mind. Keep going, gang.","pln_cs1_101_03":"Stand by, gang. Organizing an exit. Hold the line!","pln_cs1_103_01":"Keep it cool. Keep it under control, gang.","pln_cs1_104_01":"We need that vault open. Quiet with keycards, or bust it open with a drill.","pln_cs1_106_01":"The cage is ready. When you're ready for the plane, send up that balloon.","pln_cs1_107_03":"Keycard. Great. You need to use it on the vault, but that's only half of it. Swipe it, and then hunt down the second card.","pln_cs1_108_01":"Halfway there. Find the other card, and swipe it.","pln_cs1_108_03":"Job's half done. Find the second keycard and you can walk into the vault.","pln_cs1_109_01":"You need to keep an eye on that cage. The cops can lift the bags right out of there.","pln_cs1_10_02":"Remember to go grab the thermal drill.","pln_cs1_110_03":"There goes your driver. He's left a drill behind. Get it, and keep working!","pln_cs1_112_01":"Don't forget the bags.","pln_cs1_113_01":"You guys got lucky. The vault's already open!","pln_cs1_113_03":"Vault is open. New plan. Just stroll in and get to work. Easy money!","pln_cs1_118_02":"A laser gate! That was unexpected. Touching that will set off their alarm. Watch the cycle, wait for it to blink off, and then run through.","pln_cs1_118_03":"Goddammit, a laser gate. We've dealt with these before. Just wait for it to flicker off, and then dash through.","pln_cs1_119_01":"Thank you for your call. Roberts appreciates the chance to talk to you.","pln_cs1_11_03":"Thats it! Now let's get it to work on that vault.","pln_cs1_121_01":"You're through to Mortimer at Roberts Bank. I'd be happy to assist.","pln_cs1_126_01":"Roberts Bank. Everything's under control. How can I help you?","pln_cs1_127_01":"I'll get right onto that.","pln_cs1_13_02":"We're almost there. Time to patch through to my pilot.","pln_cs1_14_01":"He's going to drop off the pieces for a skyhook. You gotta bolt together an aluminum cage, load it and then send up a cable on a balloon. Plane flies right over, grabs the cable and - whoosh! - off it goes. ","pln_cs1_159_01":"Damn. Alright. Expect company, gang.","pln_cs1_17_03":"The bags go into the cage. The plane gets the cage. We get rich. Easy.","pln_cs1_20_02":"The plane will collect the cage from the parking lot, so get these bags there and get building.","pln_cs1_22_01":"That's perfect. The cage is assembled.","pln_cs1_23_02":"Hustle it, gang - our pilot can't stick around forever. Get the bags to the cage.","pln_cs1_23_03":"Let's load that cage up, gang. The pilot has a tight schedule.","pln_cs1_24_03":"Great. Keep going.","pln_cs1_25_03":"OK, gang, good. Now hold on.","pln_cs1_27_02":"Dead on target! Our flyboy earned his cut today.","pln_cs1_29_01":"The glamorous life of a heister, huh? Find the exit.","pln_cs1_31_02":"You found the exit, but it's not ready yet. You need to go back and secure the cash.","pln_cs1_31_03":"Sorry, gang. You need to get more cash before leaving. Hold your breath and head back.","pln_cs1_32_02":"The pilot is on his way with the bags. Hold the line!","pln_cs1_32_03":"Plane is en route. Just hold on, gang.","pln_cs1_33_03":"Crap, that's the alarm. Alright, gang - time to go loud.","pln_cs1_34_01":"Well, so much for stealth. But the job's half done. Just get that money out of there.","pln_cs1_36_01":"Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Our boys are ready. Drop the skyhook cage. Over.","pln_cs1_42_02":"This is Mortimer. At the bank. Your money is safe. Now, how can I help you?","pln_cs1_44_01":"Uh, Barney's not available right now. Can I take a message?","pln_cs1_48_01":"No. Uh, just give me a second...","pln_cs1_51_03":"It's got to be among these papers. Let's see. This is a B7040, that's not it. A FU5000. No, let me keep looking...","pln_cs1_59_01":"Remember to keep an eye on any bags in the cage. Cops can still snatch them.","pln_cs1_61_01":"Shooters on the roof. Watch out!","pln_cs1_64_01":"They're trying to flank you at the parking lot. ","pln_cs1_65_01":"Thought it would take longer for them to react, but we got cops on the scene.","pln_cs1_72_03":"The Gensec truck's a bonus. A keycard in it would be a sweeter bonus.","pln_cs1_75_02":"SWAT have sent a heavy truck. They're taking this seriously. Knuckle down.","pln_cs1_76_02":"SWAT's on the roofs, guys. Don't let them get dug in.","pln_cs1_79_02":"They say crap rolls downhill but here it's flows everywhere. This is a goddamn maze.","pln_cs1_79_03":"Those old sewers are a maze. Keep looking for the light, guys. Ignore the stench.","pln_cs1_82_03":"An access ladder, with the hatch unlocked. These sloppy assholes deserve to be robbed.","pln_cs1_83_02":"Deposit boxes! Start breaking them, gang. One bag is minimum, but take as much as you can.","pln_cs1_83_03":"Open the boxes. Our client demands one bag, but your professional honor demands you take as much as you can.","pln_cs1_86_01":"Thats three. You're going strong. Keep going.","pln_cs1_89_01":"Six bags. I'm getting buttery thinking of all that extra loot.","pln_cs1_92_01":"Nine bags! You guys are legendary. ","pln_cs1_96_03":"They've got every road out of there blocked. Time to go Vietcong on them. You'll see what I mean.","pln_cs1_99_01":"See that drive thru window at the side of the bank? There's a manhole there to the sewers. Get down there.","pln_cs1_cbf_01_03":"Here it is, guys. Another bank job. The bread and butter of the heisting lifestyle. This time we're hitting a branch of Roberts Bank. My sources say they're getting, or just got, a tasty shipment. Let's pay them a visit.","pln_cs1_end_01_02":"Nice approach. Gensec will have a lot of explaining to do. Let's divide this and lay low.","pln_cs1_end_01_03":"Cash is king. We don't even need a cleaner crew after this one. Smooth!","pln_cs1_intro_01_01":"There's the bank. Pull over. Keep it cool.","pln_csod_01_01":"The cops just shut of the drill!","pln_csod_01_02":"The drill is out - damn cops!","pln_dah_02_02":"The vault has two security routers protecting it and you need to shut them both down. Easily done if you patch me into them directly. Look for them mounted on the walls. ","pln_dah_03_01":"Look on the walls for the router boxes.","pln_dah_05_03":"OK, good. Now take care of the other router.","pln_dah_06_02":"It's going to take me a while to shut this down.","pln_dah_09_02":"That's one security box taken care of.","pln_dah_100_03":"Use ziplines to get the bags out via the garden.","pln_dah_101_03":"A zipline will get you done a lot faster!","pln_dah_103_02":"Guys, I have to pull the chopper out until things cool down.","pln_dah_103_03":"Stand by guys, the chopper has to do a little detour until things calm down.","pln_dah_105_01":"One more bag, then you get leave.","pln_dah_107_01":".. or stay and bag a little more. Up to you!","pln_dah_107_02":".. or take a little more.","pln_dah_109_01":"Helicopter is waiting.","pln_dah_109_02":"What're you waiting for?","pln_dah_109_06":"Chop-chop. To the chopper.","pln_dah_109_08":"Job is over guys. Time to go.","pln_dah_110_01":"The party seems to have stopped. People are leaving!","pln_dah_110_03":"No more party people, they're all heading out.","pln_dah_115_02":"Ralph just showed himself. Keep you eyes open!","pln_dah_11_01":"You still need to find the three laptops to get the code fragments.","pln_dah_120_02":"Get to the roof and signal the chopper if you're ready to leave!","pln_dah_12_04":"Found those laptops yet?","pln_dah_12_05":"Remember, find those laptops.","pln_dah_16_02":"I think there's a PC in the fitness center.","pln_dah_17_01":"Something in the cafeteria and it isn't Jeff Vader. It looks like a glowing LCD display. ","pln_dah_17_03":"Might want to check out the cafeteria. I can see a PC monitor there.","pln_dah_19_03":"Right by the Jade Room, looks like a computer.","pln_dah_20_02":"The Glitter Room might be worth checking for a laptop.","pln_dah_22_01":"You'll probably find a computer in Administration.","pln_dah_27_03":"Might want to check the contruction site for a computer.","pln_dah_28_01":"Management Office, they always have portable computers.","pln_dah_29_03":"I think there's a computer in Sales. Go take a look.","pln_dah_32_02":"I'm thinkin' that both number and color are important.","pln_dah_33_02":"Good going. Only one more color-number set to go.","pln_dah_34_03":"That's the last piece of the code.","pln_dah_35_01":"Ok, now you need a keycard. Find Ralph Garnet and take it from him. He should be around there somewhere.","pln_dah_35_03":"Ralph Garnet has the last piece of the puzzle. Find him and take his keycard. He's around there somewhere.","pln_dah_40_01":"It ain't gonna open itself. Use the keycard and code.","pln_dah_40_02":"That vault is just waiting to be emptied guys. Use the keycard, then enter the code.","pln_dah_42_01":"Don't smash the glass or the alarm will go off. Use a glass-cutter.","pln_dah_42_03":"Watch the glass. Cut through it instead of smashing or the alarm will go.","pln_dah_43_01":"You need to get the bags to the platform where you came in. ","pln_dah_43_02":"Get the bags to the window-washing platform.","pln_dah_47_01":"There's a juicy bonus waiting for us if you crack that second vault.","pln_dah_48_01":"The stones in cases are top priority, but grab whatever else you can.","pln_dah_48_02":"Every little bit helps, but the rocks in cases are most important.","pln_dah_49_05":"No time to relax yet.","pln_dah_51_03":"Almost there.","pln_dah_52_01":"OK, that's our minimum. Grab more if you want, or get out of there.","pln_dah_52_03":"That's it. Stay and grab more of get out. Your call.","pln_dah_53_01":"Great, that's everything, now get out of there!","pln_dah_55_01":"OK, that's it. Time to go.","pln_dah_55_02":"No more time to party, just get out.","pln_dah_55_03":"It's time to leave guys.","pln_dah_55_05":"No time for snacks. Get out, ASAP.","pln_dah_57_03":"We need a change of plan, the code has been shut down!","pln_dah_58_02":"Damn, looks like the only thing that will work now is the master code. Let me see if I can find out who has it.","pln_dah_58_03":"They just disabled your code. There might be another- a master code, but I'll have to find out who has it.","pln_dah_61_02":"Damn, they know you're there now for sure.","pln_dah_64_02":"I've come up with a plan B, just find those routers!","pln_dah_65_03":"You need to find those routers!","pln_dah_67_01":"Great! I'm in.","pln_dah_67_02":"Ok, let me see...","pln_dah_68_01":"Cops are trying to stop us. Defend those routers while I work!","pln_dah_69_08":"Drop any cop that gets close!","pln_dah_71_02":"OK,I'm done here!","pln_dah_73_02":"We're stuck without that keycard. Find Ralph garnet!","pln_dah_74_01":"Right, time to get the master code. The CFO will have it.","pln_dah_74_03":"Kick the shit out of the exacutive ladder. Find the CFO and get his master code!","pln_dah_75_03":"You still need to find the master code!","pln_dah_76_01":"He's lying through his teeth. Get him to the chopper, I'll get the code out of him.","pln_dah_77_01":"C'mon guys, get that guy to the roof.","pln_dah_79_03":"I'll crack this guy like an egg and have that code for you shortly.","pln_dah_80_02":"You need to swipe Ralph's card before the code.","pln_dah_81_02":"Listen up, the code is...","pln_dah_83_02":"One","pln_dah_85_01":"Three","pln_dah_85_02":"Three","pln_dah_87_01":"Five","pln_dah_89_01":"Seven","pln_dah_89_02":"Seven","pln_dah_90_02":"Eight","pln_dah_92_02":"You get that? The code is...","pln_dah_92_05":"Here it is again.","pln_dah_95_02":"Loot for the taking...","pln_dah_97_01":"Probably worth a fortune.","pln_dah_99_02":"Every little bit helps, but the rocks in cases are most important.","pln_dah_end_stealth_03":"Textbook execution people.","pln_dah_intro_03":"All right, you're almost on the 22nd. Get going and don't get a nose-bleed up there. ","pln_dn1_03_01":"What? We didn't lay a damn thing. How is that possible?","pln_dn1_06_02":"The truck is in the slaughterhouse. There's C4 stashed in those bins. Grab it and bust in.","pln_dn1_06_03":"All right, the truck is through there. Grab the C4 from the bin and blow that door.","pln_dn1_10_02":"Good work. Now, C4 the doors!","pln_dn1_11_01":"Plant C4 on the truck doors, gang.","pln_dn1_13_02":"Drill on the safe, just like we planned. Hurry!","pln_dn1_15_02":"Get the gold out to container 61, crew.","pln_dn1_16_02":"Ok I have an idea for that heli. Pour some gas on those tires and light it up. Should create a smokescreen.","pln_dn1_18_02":"Gang, find gas and ignite the tires. Give that chopper a nice thick smokescreen to worry about!","pln_dn1_19_03":"The smoke looks thick enough from here. All right, choppers are bugging out.","pln_dn1_22_02":"Use the control panel in the yard to move that firetrap.","pln_dn1_23_03":"Use the crane to lift the gold container onto the truck.","pln_dn1_24_03":"Gotta get the container with the gold loaded on the truck. The crane can do it.","pln_dn1_25_03":"Outstanding. We're almost done - now get to the escape. Just stay with the blue containers!","pln_dn1_26_03":"Get to the escape point, clowns! Follow the blue containers!","pln_dn1_27_02":"Close the door in their faces. Blast the gas!","pln_dn1_28_01":"Gang, ignite the trap!","pln_dn1_31_01":"We bloodied their nose AND got their gold. Great job!","pln_dn1_31_02":"That's a LOT of beautiful gold. Outstanding work, gang!","pln_dn1_32_01":"Great you got the gas. Might need more though.","pln_dn1_32_02":"Grab as much gas as you can.","pln_dn1_32_03":"You're reading my mind. We're going to need that gas later.","pln_dn1_33_02":"We got regular cops and SWATS on the scene.","pln_dn1_34_03":"Police chopper is over you. We can't let them see which container we use.","pln_dn1_38_01":"Hey! Gang, we can't lift the container while you're inside.","pln_dn1_39_01":"The van's stuck up there! Plant the C4 on the bottom, blow it open.","pln_dn1_40_02":"All right, good find. Now get that gas all over the tires.","pln_dn1_41_02":"Okay, that gas will help secure our escape. Put the can into the container.","pln_dn1_cbf_01_01":"Got word on a truck filled with gold. Only problem is, it's guarded by our old friends - Murkywater. But hey, nothing you guys can't handle right?","pln_dn1_cnc_01_01":"Smash and grab on a Murkywater convoy laden with gold.","pln_dn1_intro_01_01":" ...and also on the 45 going south, there's been a major accident that's clogging the entire freeway.  It's like a war zone out there this morning so you better take a scenic route.","pln_drk_01_01":"Okay, gang. The train yard is right in front of you. There should be several ways you can infiltrate the place, so make your choices wisely.","pln_drk_01_02a":"This is your chance to plan your course of action.","pln_drk_01_03":"That's it, the hidden train yard. Use this opportunity to scout the area. The place is heavily guarded by Murkies and cameras, so we can't afford to make any mistakes.","pln_drk_04_01a":"They should have some kind of panels on the side.","pln_drk_04_03":"The Murkywater trains will have a security panel on the side, so we'll have to hack them open.","pln_drk_07_01":"Open your eyes and find the EMP. Come on.","pln_drk_08_03":"Damn, where did this door come from? Sorry, gang. I had no information this would be here...","pln_drk_13_03":"You need to actually use the keycard, you know?","pln_drk_21_01":"Gang, we still need a way to get through that steel gate . You need to find something that we can use.","pln_drk_21_02":"You still need to find something we can use to get through those bars.","pln_drk_21_03":"Guys, find something we can use on those bars. Something that doesn't give off too much noise.","pln_drk_25_02":"If we could get our hands on a hard drive, we might be able to hack the system to the vault.","pln_drk_27_02":"With this hard drive I should be able to override their security and get the vault open.","pln_drk_28_02":"Get back to the train and use the hard drive. I should be able to override the security.","pln_drk_29_02":"Sure, why not? We might find use for it later.","pln_drk_30_02":"Great, now we can open the crates laying around much faster. I bet you they contain some good stuff.","pln_drk_30_03":"If you're planning on sticking around for extra loot, that crowbar will do the trick.","pln_drk_35_03":"With the EMP secured, there is some time to kill before the escape vehicle arrives.","pln_drk_37_01":"Listen up, gang. Twitch is coming in with the van. He will come from the upper bridge side.","pln_drk_38_02":"This ventilation system could be used to our advantage, you know, to hide a body or transfer some of the extra through.","pln_drk_41_01":"Nice, you took that sucker out. But hide the mess. The guards will react if they find out you destroyed one of their drones.","pln_drk_43_01":"Guys, the maintenance tunnels could have what we're looking for.","pln_drk_44_01":"There's several rooms in the maintenance tunnels. Have you checked all of them?","pln_drk_45_01":"Check between the trains too, guys. Don't get sloppy.","pln_drk_45_02":"There's space between the trains too. It's worth a look.","pln_drk_46_02":"The area isn't too big. You should be able to move around and search all corners of the whole train yard.","pln_drk_46_03":"There's four of you, guys. Spread out if needed and check all corners of the train yard.","pln_drk_47_01":"Damn, looks like the EMP isn't in this train car. There could still be some valuable loot here, so either grab it now or come back for it later. Your choice.","pln_drk_48_01":"Damn it! That's the alarm!","pln_ed1_01_02":"An old fashioned break in. Stay out of sight.","pln_ed1_02_02":"Great. Now search the docks. You're looking for something that tells you which truck has the voting machines and is headed for Washington. Search containers, computers - anything. When you've figured it out, tag the right truck.","pln_ed1_04_01":"They've seen you! The trucks are moving out. Alright, we need a Plan B. Lemme think.","pln_ed1_04_03":"The trucks are on the move. Someone saw you! OK, time for another plan.","pln_ed1_05_01":"OK, let's try this. Find something connected to the dock's network. I should be able to pull up their shipping manifests. Might have some clue about where they're headed.","pln_ed1_05_03":"Alright, I have an idea. I want you to hack into anything you can find connected down there. If I can get access to their databases, I might be able to find where our truck is headed.","pln_ed1_07_01":"OK, the first database is downloaded. Looks great but it's not complete. You can haul ass now, or stay and download the whole database. Your call.","pln_ed1_07_02":"I got the first half of the database. It may be enough, maybe not, so it's your call - get out of there now, or stay and get the second half.","pln_ed1_09_01":"That terminal is showing which truck is going where. Keep checking. It might help pinpoint our truck.","pln_ed1_intro_a_02":"Pier 39. Find the truck that has the voting machines. It will be bound for Washington. Figure out which one it is, slap on the tracker and get the hell out. Keep it quiet.","pln_ed2_02_03":"Your next target is the voting machines. I'll bet they're stored in sealed crates. You clowns will need to improvise to open them.","pln_ed2_05_02":"That certainly looks like one of the voting machines. When you're ready to kill democracy, start the hack. Make sure no-one sees you.","pln_ed2_07_03":"The machine's done. That should make The Elephant happy. Now close up the crate and keep going.","pln_ed2_08_03":"We got that one hacked. Keep looking at it.","pln_ed2_10_02":"Here's the new plan. I'm altering the hack to make it look like this whole enterprise is for Mayor Schwartz instead.

Please.","pln_fs2_02_any_01":"Obvious, but the front door is probably not the best move. There's bound to be better entrances.","pln_fs2_02_any_03":"That entrance looks tough.

This is our old loot, isn't it?","pln_fs2_29_any_02":"Shutters are down. Only way out is the entrance.","pln_fs2_29_any_03":"Damn it! They locked you in. Main entrance is the only option now!","pln_fs3_03_any_02":"OK, power's down. No more shocks. I hope.","pln_fs3_04_any_01":"OK, Hector wants us to record this, so first: set up the camera.","pln_fs3_05_any_02":"Go ahead and burn it. I know, it's sad...","pln_fs3_06_any_01":"OK, while we wait for the money to burn you can open up some of those deposit boxes. Whatever we find in there is ours.","pln_fs3_07_any_01":"OK, enough money making, take the recording and make a run for it, unless you wanna hang around for more loot.","pln_fs3_07_any_02":"OK, thats enough. Get the recording and lets get out of here.","pln_fs3_08_any_01":"The van is right around the corner.","pln_fs3_09_any_01":"The van is right across the street.","pln_fwb_01_02":"Go inside.","pln_fwb_02_02":"We gotta find the bank manager.","pln_fwb_03_01":"Find the bank manager, then tie him down and you'll get the keycard.","pln_fwb_04_01":"He's balding, wears a black suit. Most likely busy on his phone. Looks like he's ready to hand out pink slips.","pln_fwb_04_02":"The bank manager wears a black suit. Balding. He looks like the kind of creep who spends all day on his phone.","pln_fwb_04_03":"Look out for the manager. 40's, black suit, balding. Probably around the back offices. ","pln_fwb_04_04":"You're looking for the manager. Mid 40's, balding, black suit. Soulless, heartless, greedy...you know the type.","pln_fwb_04_06":"Find the manager. Look for the creepy guy in a suit. 40's. Going bald. That'll be him.","pln_fwb_04_08":"Keep an eye open for the manager. Black suited creep, losing a bit up top, mid 40's. Get his keycard.","pln_fwb_05_02":"Great. Now use the card to get inside the server room. Second floor.","pln_fwb_06_02":"We need to deal with the metal detectors. Best way: simply kill the power. There are electricity boxes around.","pln_fwb_06_03":"The metal detectors need to be shut down. You can do that by disabling the power. Look for circuit boxes.","pln_fwb_07_02":"Crew, you need to deal with the metal detectors. They use a lot of electricity so find and shut down the circuit boxes.","pln_fwb_07_03":"There are circuit boxes around the place. Disabling them will shut down the metal detectors.","pln_fwb_08_03":"That's the metal detectors dealt with. Great.","pln_fwb_10_03":"I got an Inside Man there. They'll help us get through to the gates leading to the vault. Patching them through now.","pln_fwb_11_01":"You heard her. I've done a little homework and marked some terminals that should have the 4-digit code in 'em somewhere.","pln_fwb_12_01":"Check the marked terminals, gang. We're looking for a code.","pln_fwb_12_02":"The terminals. You see 'em? You need to check them for the code.","pln_fwb_12_03":"We need the gate code, crew. Get searching those terminals.","pln_fwb_13_02":"Now, what will we find?","pln_fwb_13_05":"Acessing now...","pln_fwb_13_07":"Fingers crossed this is the one","pln_fwb_13_08":"Give me a second to check...","pln_fwb_14_02":"Christ, a lot of office gossip, but no codes. Next.","pln_fwb_14_06":"CD interest rate, 50%! But no code. Keep looking.","pln_fwb_15_01":"Aaand here we go: The code is... 1138.","pln_fwb_15_03":"And the code is....1138!","pln_fwb_18_01":"Next, we need to gain access to the main vault. It's controlled by two keycard terminals, and each needs activating within seconds of the other. So find two keycards.","pln_fwb_19_01":"You're looking for two keycards. Look around the desks, offices.","pln_fwb_19_04":"How are you doing tracking down those two keycards?","pln_fwb_19_05":"Search the offices, desks - those keycards are around there somewhere.","pln_fwb_20_03":"Good. Now find the second keycard.","pln_fwb_22_02":"And now the vault keypanel! Hustle!","pln_fwb_22_03":"Now swipe the vault keypanel! Come on!","pln_fwb_23_01":"Too slow, try again.","pln_fwb_23_02":"Just missed it. Try again.","pln_fwb_27_03":"So when you have your fill, I need you to drop the bags into this vent here. We'll pick 'em up later.","pln_fwb_28_03":"See that vent by the elevator? That's where you gotta stash the bags.","pln_fwb_29_03":"Once you're ready to bounce, find our Insider. She's going to help you slip out of there.","pln_fwb_30_01":"Find our Insider. She'll show you out.","pln_fwb_30_03":"Meet up with the Insider. She'll get you out of there.","pln_fwb_31_01":"Stay low and quiet. Offices are never empty.","pln_fwb_33_01":"All right, there's the truck and there's our bags. Stash the loot into the truck, quick!","pln_fwb_34_03":"And that is how you do it! Text book execution, gang! Congratulations!","pln_fwb_35_01":"There's the alarm, gentlemen. Start the countdown.","pln_fwb_35_03":"Time for plan B. Start the countdown.","pln_fwb_36_02":"The manager's probably crapping his black threads somewhere. Find him. Get his keycard.","pln_fwb_37_01":"Now pick up the drill and the thermite, it's hidden inside the copy machine!","pln_fwb_37_02":"Got a drill and some thermite hidden in the copy machine in the server room. Go get it.","pln_fwb_38_02":"There's two cans of thermite there. One of you other guys grab it.","pln_fwb_39_01":"There's one more can of thermite in the copy machine. Maybe come back for it?","pln_fwb_39_02":"There's two cans of thermite there. Maybe you can come back later?","pln_fwb_40_03":"Now, let's mount the drill on the gates.","pln_fwb_41_03":"Crew, get drilling the gate. Hustle it!","pln_fwb_42_01":"The insider sure delivered. Now keep an eye on the drill - it'll surely jam every once in a while.","pln_fwb_42_02":"Now let the drill do it's thing. Keep the cops off it.","pln_fwb_43_01":"The alarm has activated a second feature on the gate - a magnetic seal. Drill can't touch that, so you need to access a terminal to release it.","pln_fwb_43_02":"OK guys - while the drill does the lock, we're going to deal with the gates' magnetic seal. Let me find a good terminal.","pln_fwb_43_03":"Okay, the alarm has kicked in a secondary lock on the gate - a magnetic seal. You need a terminal to release that. Let me find one.","pln_fwb_44_02":"Okay, see that terminal I marked. Get over there, hack in and let's kill that magnetic seal.","pln_fwb_44_03":"I've found a terminal. Get to it, hack in and we lower that magnetic seal.","pln_fwb_45_02":"That's it for the seal. Now keep an eye on the drill.","pln_fwb_45_03":"Okay, the seal is down. Protect the drill!","pln_fwb_46_01":"The drill is done - the gates are opening! Go through and head down the vault corridor. Find the counting room right above the vault and pour out the thermite.","pln_fwb_47_01":"Find the counting room right above the vault and pour out the thermite.","pln_fwb_47_02":"Enter the room right above the vault and pour out the thermite.","pln_fwb_48_02":"Okay. Now hold them off til the thermite finishes.","pln_fwb_49_02":"Did any of you grab that second can? Extra thermite means extra heat which means less time.","pln_fwb_49_03":"Who has the second thermite can? More thermite means a hotter burn. Basic chemistry. ","pln_fwb_52_01":"Come on, jump down into the vault!","pln_fwb_53_01":"Put the moneybag on the floor and grab some cash!","pln_fwb_53_02":"There's the beautiful cash. Get bagging it, crew!","pln_fwb_55_01":"The cops are in control of the vault doors. They will open any second - be ready!","pln_fwb_55_02":"Damn cops are at the door. Get ready for them!","pln_fwb_57_02":"Right, here's our way out. Get back upstairs, and C4 the wall into the adjoining building.","pln_fwb_57_03":"You're not going to just stroll out the front. Get upstairs, and blast through into the office next door. That's the way out.","pln_fwb_59_03":"Get upstairs, crew! That's where you'll be blasting through!","pln_fwb_60_01":"Blow a hole in the wall and get ready to run!","pln_fwb_60_04":"Put the C4 on the wall and stay back!","pln_fwb_62_01":"Go through the hole! Head to the neighboring building!","pln_fwb_62_03":"Through the hole, gang! You're getting out of there!","pln_fwb_63_01":"There's a garbage truck waiting in the basement garage. Get down there and stash the loot there, quick!","pln_fwb_63_02":"The garbage truck is waiting in the garage for the money bags. Get down there, get it secured!","pln_fwb_63_03":"This office has a basement garage. A garbage truck is waiting for the bags. Get down there, and get them secured!","pln_fwb_64_02":"Just dash through and head downstairs to the garage!","pln_fwb_64_03":"We're almost done. Get down to the garage, secure that loot!","pln_fwb_65_01":"Outstanding, gang! I wish all trips to the bank ended so happily.","pln_fwb_65_02":"That was a great show, gang! Watching those accounts rise, and their shares topple. ","pln_fwb_67_03":"The cops will go all out to stop us here. Show 'em what we do.","pln_fwb_68_03":"That's the front and the upstairs dark as far as cameras are concerned. Cameras in the vault area run on a seperate circuit though.","pln_fwb_69_02":"That's the last camera in the vault area. Good job.","pln_fwb_69_03":"You poked out their eyes in the vault area. No more cameras back there.","pln_fwb_70_02":"That's all the cameras dealt with. The whole bank is blind to us now. Great!","pln_fwb_70_03":"And... The bank is dark to us. Good work, crew. ","pln_fwb_brf_01_01":"The vault is buried deep in the back of the bank. Getting through to it will be tough, but we have some help. An Inside Man is prepped and waiting for you.

First task: get on the other side of that fence.","pln_hb3_03_03":"Your first job is getting beyond the perimeter.","pln_hb3_04_02":"Check the fence. Always got to be a way over, through or under.","pln_hb3_04_03":"There must a way to get beyond the fence. Check it out.","pln_hb3_06_02":"Open a door or window and the alarm timer will kick in. You'll only have a few seconds to disable it, before it goes to hell.","pln_hb3_07_01":"Look in through the windows and try to find the alarm box. You'll have a limited time to disable it once you're inside, so it's best to be prepared.","pln_hb3_07_03":"Look inside before going in. Find the alarm box. When you open a door or window, it'll start, so you need to disable it fast.","pln_hb3_08_01":"You just triggered the countdown! Find and disable the alarm before it's timer runs out!","pln_hb3_08_03":"And there's the countdown. Now, find the alarm! Disable it before it kicks in.","pln_hb3_09_01":"Phew, the alarm is disabled. No need to worry about opening doors or windows now!","pln_hb3_10_03":"Gang, get into the house. Come on, move it!","pln_hb3_11_02":"The traitor will be in the panic room, so you have to find it. Then we can work on getting it open.","pln_hb3_13_03":"We're going to need a thermal lance to get through that thing. Looks like the Fed's really want this guy kept alive.

The panic room door is controlled with two keycards and a retinal scanner. No problem.","pln_hb3_17_01":"Alright. The panic room door is controlled with a code and a special key. Just find that code and key. Simple!","pln_hb3_17_02":"Looks like an entry code and a key are needed for external access. Go look for them.","pln_hb3_18_01":"OK, the panic room door is controlled with two keycards and a special key. Track 'em down.","pln_hb3_18_02":"That door needs two keycards and a key. Start looking for them.","pln_hb3_20_01":"Good, it's searching the computer now. Make sure no one spots the computer when it's active.","pln_hb3_20_02":"Nice. It's searching the archived emails. Keep the Feds away til it finishes.","pln_hb3_20_03":"It's searching now. Christ, wish they spent as much on their servers as they do on their doors. Don't let anyone see.","pln_hb3_21_01":"OK, we got it! Use the code on the panic room!","pln_hb3_21_02":"That's it! Get the code to the panic room!","pln_hb3_22_03":"Alright, here's an idea. We're going to make a little call. Get to the telephone outside the house.","pln_hb3_23_03":"Nice. That's it. Alright, one of you guys monkey up there.","pln_hb3_24_01":"OK. Get access to their comm relay. We're gonna make it look like we're making a call from the house.","pln_hb3_25_01":"Place a call to the FBI HQ. I'll do the talking.","pln_hb3_25_03":"Alright. Put the call through. Let me talk to the Feds.","pln_hb3_26_01":"Yes, hi, this is Agent Dave from the safe house. I need to talk with the informant urgently, requesting today's code. Sorry, didn't get my coffee this morning.","pln_hb3_26_02":"Hi, this is Special Agent, uh, Smith. Can you tell me the panic room code? Our terminals are down. Can't get today's code.","pln_hb3_27_01":"Yes, sir, will do. Thank you!","pln_hb3_27_03":"That's great. Thank you.","pln_hb3_28_01":"OK, for the retinal scanner we need the FBI boss. Find him and take him hostage!","pln_hb3_28_02":"Alright, The retinal scanner needs an eye. Unfortunately, one with a pulse. So find the FBI boss there and take him hostage.","pln_hb3_30_02":"Gang, lead him to the scanner. Make him use it!","pln_hb3_30_03":"You need to get that guy to the scanner. Force him to look into it.","pln_hb3_31_03":"Gotta get two keycards working on that door.","pln_hb3_33_03":"The key is likely held by someone like an FBI boss. Find him. Get it.","pln_hb3_34_01":"OK, you got the key. Excellent. Now use it!","pln_hb3_35_03":"OK, we go loud! That panic room is secure, so you'll need a thermal lance to get through. It's on the way.","pln_hb3_36_01":"Bile is on his way with the thermal lance. Won't be long!","pln_hb3_36_02":"Bile is en-route with the lance. Hold the line!","pln_hb3_36_03":"Stay alive. Bile will drop the lance soon.","pln_hb3_38_02":"Fellas, fetch the lance!","pln_hb3_38_03":"One of you needs to grab the lance.","pln_hb3_39_01":"Put the thermal lance to good use and get the panic room open.","pln_hb3_39_02":"Get the thermal lance onto the panic room door.","pln_hb3_40_02":"Now get that door open. Time to reveal the rat.","pln_hb3_41_01":"Kill the rat!","pln_hb3_42_01":"Guys, wait... is that... Hector!? What the... fuck? Why the hell... I don't get this. Wait... the Watchdogs job, so that's why the cops were waiting for us. It was an ambush. That son of a bitch.","pln_hb3_43_03":"We can piss on his bones later. Right now, we gotta deal with the evidence littered throughout the house.","pln_hb3_44_03":"We could have used that guy. Ah well. Switch to the back up plan.","pln_hb3_45_01":"Damn, the retinal scanner means we needed the boss alive. Now, we'll have to do it loud.","pln_hb3_46_03":"It's too hot for the van driver. He's bugging out. Don't worry, though. Got a chopper gassed and ready for you.","pln_hb3_47_01":"OK, time to get the hell out of here. Go!","pln_hb3_47_02":"Time to leave, gang! Hurry!","pln_hb3_47_03":"You're done, and it's time to split. Come on, move!","pln_hb3_48_01":"Chopper's here!","pln_hb3_49_02":"Oh crap, the FBI has Ready Teams in the houses next to the safe house. They're coming for you!","pln_hb3_50_03":"Damn, snipers are setting up around the perimeter. Watch out and only go outside if you need to!","pln_hb3_52_03":"Looks like the FBI boss is closs to your position. Don't kill him, he might be useful.","pln_hb3_53_03":"For every bag of evidence you secure, I will provide compensation. Crime.net needs to be protected.","pln_hb3_54_02":"An inside contact has rigged up spy cameras and surveillance drones. You can access them from the gadget on the roof.","pln_hb3_54_03":"An FBI connection of mine has rigged the place with spy cameras and has set up surveillance drones outside. You can control them from the gadget on the roof.","pln_hb3_55_02":"Shit, the timelock has paused. Must be your ECM jammer that's making it go ape! Better holster those jammers.","pln_hb3_56_02":"What?!! You let the FBI boss slip away? He's left the scene! Well, he's not coming back. Gotta switch to plan B.","pln_hb3_57_02":"Guys! You didn't take care of the alarmbox.","pln_hb3_58_03":"Disable the alarm! It's counting down and things are gonna get real messy once it reaches 0.","pln_hb3_59_01":"I think that's enough evidence to kill their case against us, but I won't object if you get more.","pln_hb3_59_03":"Their case against us probably won't recover from the amount of evidence we've stolen, but you're free to steal more.","pln_hb3_brf_01_01":"Alright. Finally, we're going after the rat - the fink who screwed Hox, wants to screw us all. Time to put him down. We know he's currently bunkering down in an FBI safe house outside the city. These safe houses are usually built along the same lines. Nice big houses, grounds, 24 hour security, and most likely a panic room somewhere inside. See where your tax dollars go? The plan is simple - get in there, find our informer and finish him. Now, I'm betting there'll be evidence against us in there too, so be good to clean that up too.","pln_hd1_01_01":"Alright. First goal - get inside. Front door's right ahead, but maybe show a little guile and look for other ways in. ","pln_hd1_01_02":"First job is getting inside. The front door is right there. But there's maybe other ways in.","pln_hd1_02_02":"Right, let's try and get this security shut down. You need to find the circuit boxes that power the system. Get hooked in to them. I can hack them to power down the system without tripping their wires.","pln_hd1_02_03":"Let's see if we can shut the security down. Its weak points are the circuit boxes scattered about. If we can hack them, we can power things down without triggering the alarm.","pln_hd1_03_02":"That's the lasers shut down! Move on, let's see what's next.","pln_hd1_03_03":"That's the last box. Cutting the power. Done! Lasers are down! Move on!","pln_hd1_04_01":"Next step... Two time locks. You need keycards to get past each. Guards won't have 'em - but the civvie researchers probably will. Find and, y'know, persuade them. They'll give up their keycards soon enough.","pln_hd1_04_02":"Hmmm, couple of timelocks. Alright, you're gonna need keycards to go through. These rent-a-cop security won't have them, but I am sure the civilian researchers will. Get them to give those cards up.","pln_hd1_05_03":"Rat! Time locks have kicked in. Alright. Forget keycards. We're going to force this.","pln_hd1_06_01":"OK, time locks are history. Now, get down there and get that final door open!","pln_hd1_06_02":"That's it for the time locks. Just get through that last door!","pln_hd1_07_03":"The lights are showing your path across the room. You see? Each light corresponds to a tile. Stay on the right tiles!","pln_hd1_08_02":"You're through. Look at it. It's beautiful. Now grab it.","pln_hd1_09_02":"You got it. The Diamond. The goddamn Diamond.","pln_hd1_10_03":"Damn! Cops are sending everyone they got. Time to make this a blood diamond. Find security!","pln_hd1_11_02":"Hey, where's the Diamond? They've lowered it into the floor! Wasn't expecting that. Calls for brutal method - break through with a drill!","pln_hd1_12_03":"In, but the alarm is counting. Find the lockdown and shut it off before it goes off. Let's try and keep this quiet.","pln_hd1_14_03":"Gas! Shit, get out of there! Now!","pln_hd1_15_01":"Alright. Give it a moment - let the gas dissapate. ","pln_hd1_15_03":"The gas will clear away. Give it a moment. ","pln_hd1_16_01":"OK, the gas is gone. Get back in there!","pln_hd1_16_02":"Gas is cleared. Get back in there. ","pln_hd1_17_02":"The chopper is on standby. Call it when you want but be warned - soon as it appears things are gonna go loud. Choose your moment.","pln_hd1_17_03":"There's a helicopter standing by to get you out. But as soon as you call it, things are going to get loud fast. So pick your moment.","pln_hd1_18_01":"See that open window? As long as things stay quiet you can secure loot by tossing it out there. A contact will pick it up for us.","pln_hd1_19_02":"We have a zip-line that can help you get loot out of there, nice and quiet. Make sure you use it.","pln_hd1_20_01":"Damn! The zip-line is useless now. Forget about securing loot on it!","pln_hd1_20_02":"Our guy at the zip-line had to run, so forget about boosting loot on that now. ","pln_hd1_21_01":"Surveillance operator is out of commision. You don't need to worry about those cameras anymore!","pln_hd1_21_02":"That's survellance dealt with. You don't need to stress over the cameras anymore.","pln_hd1_21_03":"Surveillance is blind. Cameras are out of action. Should make things easier.","pln_hd1_22_02":"Alarms are off the display cases. You want to snatch some extra goodies, now is the time. Can always shift these artifacts.","pln_hd1_22_03":"Display case alarms are off now. Get your Dr. Jones on, fellas, and grab some antiquities. I know a guy who can fence this stuff. Trust me.","pln_hd1_23_01":"Listen, each path you create will only last a limited time. You can re-create the path - just make sure you aren't standing on one of the tiles.","pln_hd1_23_02":"The path will reset after a predefined time window. You can always create a new one. Just make sure you're not standing there when it resets,","pln_hd1_25_01":"Will you look at this place. Not your usual vault, huh?","pln_hd1_26_01":"Get a keycard and swipe it through the time locks. Check civvies for cards.","pln_hd1_26_03":"Time locks can be taken down with keycards. Civilians have the keycards. You see where this is leading?","pln_hd1_29_01":"We came, we saw... We robbed a whole bunch of old Roman shit.","pln_hd1_29_03":"Don't get distracted, guys. Keep an eye out for... Oooh wait, is that from the First Triumvirate?!","pln_hd1_30_03":"Supposedly, it was Genghis that found the Diamond. He did pretty well out of it.","pln_hd1_31_01":"Woah, look at this stuff. It can't be real... Can it?","pln_hd1_31_03":"I loved this room as a kid, but now... Makes me uneasy.","pln_hd1_33_02":"Some nice loot in these displays. But some cheap counterfeit crap too. Look for alarms. That'll mark the good stuff.","pln_hd1_33_03":"Some nice stuff in those cases. Some knock-offs too. If you're going to snatch it, snatch the real stuff - look for cases with alarms. I'm sure a clever crew like you can figure it out.","pln_hd1_34_02":"Looks like every cop is headed your way! You're not driving out. Light a flare, and we'll get you an air extraction.","pln_hd1_36_02":"That's a full load. Hang tight. The chopper will be back.","pln_hd1_37_03":"Damn, that was the wrong tile! ","pln_hd1_39_01":"Quiet... Quiet. You're doing great.","pln_hd1_39_02":"Keep it quiet, gang.","pln_hd1_40_01":"The cops messed up the time lock! Get it going again!","pln_hd1_41_02":"This whole enterprise will be for nothing if you dont get that time lock tick-tocking again.","pln_hd1_42_01":"Good. Now keep the cops off of it.","pln_hd1_42_02":"Great. Now, please, keep the cops away from the time lock.","pln_hd1_44_01":"Alright. Now hook me up to that terminal again.","pln_hd1_44_02":"Get me hooked up again.","pln_heli_01_02":"Police helicopter coming in!","pln_heli_01_04":"Look up - police chopper in the sky!","pln_heli_01_05":"Eye in the sky - watch out!","pln_heli_01_06":"Police are flying in - heads up!","pln_heli_02_01":"Our chopper is coming in.","pln_heli_02_02":"That is our chopper arriving.","pln_heli_02_03":"That's our chopper landing.","pln_heli_02_04":"Heads up our chopper is incoming!","pln_heli_02_05":"Chopper coming in - it's ours.","pln_heli_03_01":"Chopper landing on the roof.","pln_heli_03_02":"Chopper is inbound - setting down on the roof.","pln_heli_03_03":"We got a chopper landing on the roof.","pln_heli_03_04":"Chopper is bound for the roof.","pln_hlp_01_01":"Damn, what is this place?","pln_hlp_01_02":"A prison? Not my favourite thing...","pln_hlp_02_01":"Let's find a way into the prison.","pln_hlp_02_02":"We probably need to enter the prison...","pln_hlp_03_03":"Looks like this gate requires a keycard. Find one guys!","pln_hlp_04_03":"Spin it, let's see what happens.","pln_hlp_05_03":"Soooo the wheel stopped on sniper... ","pln_hlp_06_02":"The wheel stopped on sniper!","pln_hlp_06_03":"The wheel has decided, looks like we have some more snipers incoming.","pln_hlp_07_02":"It landed on flames... That can't be good.","pln_hlp_08_01":"The wheel stopped on flames. Things are about to burn!","pln_hlp_08_02":"Ok the wheel landed on flames again, watch out!","pln_hlp_09_02":"The wheel stopped on smoke, no idea what that means.","pln_hlp_10_02":"Yep, it's smoke again!","pln_hlp_11_01":"Drills? Not sure what that is...","pln_hlp_12_02":"Watch out! It stopped on drills again!","pln_hlp_13_01":"Hmm.. I wonder what the question mark means.","pln_hlp_13_02":"Question marks? What could that be?","pln_hlp_15_02":"The wheel stopped on... dozer? Be careful guys Im not sure what that means.","pln_hlp_18_01":"They interrupted the timer! Restart it!","pln_hlp_18_06":"Restart the timer! They stopped it.","pln_hlp_19_01":"Once the reboot is over we should be back on track!","pln_hlp_19_02":"When the reboot has ticked down it should restart.","pln_hlp_20_01":"Great the timer is done! Grab the keycard!","pln_hlp_21_01":"Good job. Now lets get moving.","pln_hlp_21_03":"Now that you got the keycard lets move on.","pln_hlp_22_03":"Now let's enter the prison. Use the keycard to open the door.","pln_hlp_25_01":"Get that keycard into the panel and pull that switch. Let's see what happens.","pln_hlp_25_02":"Let's see... Place the keycard in the panel and activate that switch. Hope we're not in for a big suprise...","pln_hlp_25_03":"There's a slot for the keycard. My guess is just put it in and see what happens...","pln_hlp_27_04":"Go by the panel and pull that goddamn switch","pln_hlp_27_05":"What are you waiting for? That switch isn't gonna pull itself.","pln_hlp_28_01":"If you wanna leave, there's an escape panel on the top floor. Check it out if you wanna call it quits.","pln_hlp_29_01":"Same procedure as last time - grab the loot or leave this prison on the top floor.","pln_hlp_29_03":"You know the deal, grab the loot or escape.","pln_hlp_30_01":"I'm sure I don't have to explain what you need to do.","pln_hlp_30_02":"You know your way around this prison, you know what to do.","pln_hlp_30_03":"Same procedure as always.","pln_hlp_31_02":"That timer on the wall's ticking fast! Get the loot into the vent!","pln_hlp_32_01":"Careful guys, time's running out! 10 seconds!","pln_hlp_32_02":"Time's almost up!","pln_hlp_32_03":"10 seconds on the clock!","pln_hlp_34_01":"Get together in a group, guys!","pln_hlp_34_03":"Stick together team.","pln_hlp_35_01":"The place is starting to fall apart, get out!","pln_hlp_36_02":"There's a zipline leading to a train up on the bridge. Zip through the sky!","pln_hlp_37_01":"Hold on guys, I'll send some C4...","pln_hlp_38_02":"What's that, extra loot? You sure you wanna do that?","pln_hlp_38_03":"You sure you wanna be greedy now?","pln_hlp_39_02":"Run, heisters, run!","pln_hlp_39_03":"Get to the escape! HURRY!","pln_hm1_01_02":"If we wanna get Hoxton back, we gotta follow the Dentist's plan. Step one: bust up the motel.","pln_hm1_02_02":"Commissar's boys are crawling over this place like roaches. Exterminate them before they burrow into the rooms.","pln_hm1_02_03":"It's a roach motel - only the roaches are Russian mobsters. No matter. Get in there and put them down.","pln_hm1_04_01":"That's about half of 'em.","pln_hm1_07_01":"That should be all of them. Nice work!","pln_hm1_08_02":"That's it for the mobsters, gang. If they're not all dead, they're running. Either serves our purpose.","pln_hm1_09_01":"Those motel rooms look like good candidates for a little wrecking. Get in there and get your rockstar on. Smash the TV's, lamps - anything you can find.","pln_hm1_09_02":"Looks like the Commissar has spent a few roubles on those rooms. Smash 'em up! Don't forget to grab any valuables there too.","pln_hm1_10_02":"We'll send these Russians to hell. And their cars. There's a gas station nearby. See if you can find something to help the fire.","pln_hm1_11_01":"According to the Dentist, the Russian's shift a fair bit of meth out of this flea pit. Probably have a home brew operation up in one of those rooms. Smashing that up would really piss off the Commissar.","pln_hm1_12_03":"The Commissar has a methlab! I know you guys have torched a few labs in the past. Or brew a little magic, if you think got the time and can find a formula.","pln_hm1_13_03":"There's plastic explosive in the DeLorean. Set it on the Commissar's gas station, and make it go up like Sputnik!","pln_hm1_15_02":"Keep breaking things, gang.","pln_hm1_15_03":"Keep going, keep trashing!","pln_hm1_15_04":"You're doing great. Keep smashing!","pln_hm1_15_05":"Like a bull in a china shop!","pln_hm1_16_01":"Some men just want to watch the wheels burn.","pln_hm1_16_02":"Nothing I like seeing more than cheap foreign cars going up in smoke.","pln_hm1_16_03":"Commissar's men don't look like the kind of guys to have fire insurance.","pln_hm1_16_06":"That's a beautiful car. Shame. But it's part of the job.","pln_hm1_17_01":"You need to cause damage to get the Commissar to call us. Smash rooms, burn cars, kill his thugs - that should get his attention.","pln_hm1_17_02":"Get in there, and just mess the place up. Trash the rooms, light up the cars - whatever you can do. Go crazy. The Commissar is bound to give us a call.","pln_hm1_18_02":"Damn, he hung up. Somewhere in the city. Keep breaking.","pln_hm1_18_03":"The trace is working but I need more time. Get him back on the line. Keep trashing.","pln_hm1_19_01":"I'm almost there, gang. He's gotta be close to the centre. Could be... Damn, still too vague. Keep going. ","pln_hm1_19_02":"Damn, I almost had his location. Definitely near the centre. Keep at it.","pln_hm1_19_03":"So close to nailing his location. Keep going. Just get him back for a little longer.","pln_hm1_22_01":"Got him! Foggy Bottom!","pln_hm1_23_01":"Found him! He's in Shaw!","pln_hm1_24_01":"Got it! Downtown!","pln_hm1_25_01":"Got it. Georgetown! ","pln_hm1_26_01":"That's as far as I can take it. Look around for something that might narrow down his location.","pln_hm1_27_01":"Gang, there's got to be something in the motelrooms that can pinpoint the Commissar's location. Keep looking.","pln_hm1_27_02":"Keep searching the motel, guys. There has to be some clue to where the Commissar is.","pln_hm1_29_02":"A second hatch. What's the Commissar hiding in there?","pln_hm1_30_03":"Hey, maybe that hatch hides something that can help us locate the Commissar. I got an idea how we can crack it. Bile is bringing you something. ","pln_hm1_31_01":"There's gotta be more to this dump. The Dentist says the Commissar keeps his best loot in a fortified basement. I'm sure you wanna know what's in there. Search the ground floor rooms. See if you can find anything suspicious.","pln_hm1_32_02":"Bingo! Steel reinforced hatch. I've got an idea. Bile will close on your position. Get ready to fetch your present.","pln_hm1_32_03":"That's the hatch! I've got an idea for it. Bile is going to be Santa, and since you're such good boys and girls...","pln_hm1_33_01":"Happy birthday, clowns. Here's your present.","pln_hm1_34_02":"That bag's holding a heavy cable. Use it to connect the hatch to the pick-up. Start it up and let's crack open that basement.","pln_hm1_35_01":"All connected? Good. Only need to get that pick-up working.","pln_hm1_35_03":"You sure remember how to hotwire an engine. Start it up!","pln_hm1_36_01":"Is it working? Nice. But damn, that hatch is strong. ","pln_hm1_36_02":"I've seen that equipment pull a two-ton Roadwarrior out of a bog in ten seconds, but that hatch is holding tight. ","pln_hm1_36_03":"Credit to the Commissar. He hasn't been cheap with the hatch. The pick-up is pulling strong.","pln_hm1_38_01":"Two minutes!","pln_hm1_39_02":"Only one minute to go!","pln_hm1_42_01":"About halfway open now!","pln_hm1_43_01":"The cops killed the engine! Restart it!","pln_hm1_44_01":"Purring like a kitten. A 400 brake horsepower kitten. Good job!","pln_hm1_46_01":"Georgetown. Search through the files, the maps on the wall - anything that can pinpoint his exact location. Remember: it's Georgetown.","pln_hm1_46_02":"The Commissar is holed up somewhere around Georgetown. Find a clue. Something to do with Georgetown.","pln_hm1_47_03":"We know the call originated in West End. Look for something to give us a precise address. West End.","pln_hm1_48_01":"We know the Commissar is around Foggy Bottom. There must be something there that can narrow it down. Maps, files - anything. ","pln_hm1_48_02":"The Commissar is bunkered down somewhere around Foggy Bottom. Find a clue for that place.","pln_hm1_49_01":"Shaw! That's where he is. But we need to narrow it down to a precise address. Look for maps or files related to Shaw.","pln_hm1_50_01":"Those crates are headed out to the Commissar's other dirty dens. Get those labels and check them at that code reader.","pln_hm1_50_02":"Those stacked crates are due to be shipped out to the Commissar. Check the labels. Get the right one to the code reader, and that should lead us straight to the Commissar.","pln_hm1_51_03":"The adress is in the wrong district - try another code.","pln_hm1_52_03":"Excellent job! We know where he is. Now hustle back to the car. Grab any loot before the Fed's get it. You know... Those crates gave me an idea...","pln_hm1_53_03":"Dentist said they ship meth outta here. So there must be manufacturing. And meth means money.","pln_hm1_54_01":"What's that? Russian loot? Get it to the DeLorean. Hurry!","pln_hm1_54_02":"The Russians stash their loot here? Nice bonus! Toss it in the DeLorean.","pln_hm1_55_01":"Great work. Now, let's see if the big fish will bite...","pln_hm1_55_02":"Alright. Great. Lets see if he takes the bait...","pln_hm1_55_03":"That should be it! Great stuff! Come on, Commissar...  Call...","pln_hm1_56_02":"OK, drill's done. Get into the basement.","pln_hm1_57_02":"Gimme a couple of minutes to confirm the barcode. Hold on.","pln_hm1_57_03":"Checking the barcode now. Keep the cops off it.","pln_hm1_58_01":"Connect that cable to both the hatch and the truck.","pln_hm1_59_02":"Police breaching their way down. Heads up!","pln_hm1_60_02":"Chopper on the scene, but it ain't the feds!","pln_hm1_60_03":"Who's flying that chopper. Not the cops.","pln_hm1_61_03":"That pilot's had enough. Yeah, back to base, asshole.","pln_hm1_62_02":"Uh-oh, looks like Commissar's chopper is back for another bite.","pln_hm1_63_03":"It's firing! Get outta the way... Now!","pln_hm1_64_01":"Remember - track down the mobsters. Track them down, and put them down.","pln_hm1_66_01":"Neighbors must've heard gunshots. Police signals just went nuts.","pln_hm1_67_04":"Another mobster taken care of. Keep at it.","pln_hm1_68_01":"Now get that gasoline on a car and torch it!","pln_hm1_68_03":"Good! Get back to the lot, and start some fires!","pln_hm1_70_02":"Guys, I think the cops just shape charged another entrance!","pln_hm1_70_03":"What the hell! Cops just breached another way in.","pln_hm1_71_03":"Commissar's hiding at Downtown. Look for a clue for that. He's Downtown.","pln_hm1_72_01":"Guys, don't forget: douse those cars with gasoline. Light 'em up.","pln_hm1_72_02":"You got to fetch some gas and torch those cars.","pln_hm1_73_03":"I loved chemistry in high school. By that, I mean I love stuff being blown up. Good work!","pln_hm1_74_01":"Some C4 on that gas station should send a message. Get to it.","pln_hm1_75_02":"Damn! I felt that all the way over here.","pln_hm1_75_03":"Haha, you guys give new meaning to going loud.","pln_hm1_79_01":"Hmmm... He can't be in here... Neither there...","pln_hm1_79_02":"Yes! I got the - no, wait. Can't be. Damn. Almost had it.","pln_hm1_79_03":"This district matches with... Hmmm, give me some more time...","pln_hm1_79_04":"Come on, come on... Piece of Russian crap...","pln_hm1_brf_01_01":"The Dentist has sent us after a Russian mobster - calls himself the Commissar. He's got criminal interests all over the East Coast, including this motel down in the Heights. We don't know where he is, so you need to apply a little pressure. We've dropped him a hotline to us. Bust that place up as much as you can, and he should call. And when he calls, we can trace him. We're doing this for Hoxton.","pln_hm1_end_01_01":"Alright, we got the address for where the Commissar's at. It's an old apartment complex. Place is a run-down dump. Hard to say what security you can expect. Suit up, and let's finish this.","pln_hm1_end_01_03":"Commissar's holed up in a run-down apartment block. We're sneaking you in, but this is still going to get loud. Move out.","pln_hm1_intro_01_01":"The Commissar is dug in tight as a tick. This is one of his operations. Wreak havoc. If you can smash this dump up enough, he should give us a call. Then I can trace him.","pln_hm1_intro_01_02":"To get to the Commissar, we have to find the Commissar. This motel is one of his operations. Cause as much damage as you can. If he calls, I can track him.","pln_hm2_01_01":"Get those masks on, gang.","pln_hm2_02_01":"Get your mask on, and out of the damn crate.","pln_hm2_02_02":"Get out of the crates. Hit 'em with surprise.","pln_hm2_02_04":"We need to put the Commissar in a wooden box. Not stay in one ourselves. Move!","pln_hm2_02_05":"I give you these toys and all you want to do is stay in the box. Move it!","pln_hm2_03_02":"Thats him! Drop him!","pln_hm2_04_01":"Damn, the fat rat's riding the elevator. After him! Catch him before he gets away!","pln_hm2_04_02":"He's taken the elevator! Get up there after him. Do not let him escape.","pln_hm2_04_03":"He's headed up in the elevator! Chase him! He escapes, the Dentist will be pissed.","pln_hm2_05_01":"SWAT coming in! They were nearby. Wonder if they were already ready to hit him.","pln_hm2_05_02":"SWAT on their way. Guess they wanted to talk to Commissar about the battle at the motel.","pln_hm2_06_02":"Go, guys. Dont lose the scent!","pln_hm2_06_05":"Try to get up to the next floor. ","pln_hm2_08_02":"This is it. Commissar's apartment. Get through.","pln_hm2_09_01":"Where is he?!","pln_hm2_09_02":"Did the rat jump off...? No. Can't be.","pln_hm2_09_03":"Has that tricky bastard vanished?","pln_hm2_10_01":"That crafty bastard! He's using his vault as a panic room. Let me drop you a thermal drill.","pln_hm2_10_02":"A vault! The Commissar is pulling every string to keep his ass alive. I'm sending over a thermal drill.","pln_hm2_10_03":"He's locked himself in his vault, the crazy Ivan! Break it open. I'm sending you a thermal drill.","pln_hm2_11_01":"Drill is dropped. Get it. Get that vault open.","pln_hm2_12_01":"They're making a last effort. Make sure to stay away from that helicopter!","pln_hm2_13_01":"Put out those fires with the sprinkler system.","pln_hm2_14_02":"Hope you didn't get too toasty. Great job.","pln_hm2_14_03":"Fires are out. Nicely handled.","pln_hm2_14_05":"That's the fires dealt with. ","pln_hm2_14_06":"Fires' are under control. Now, back to the job.","pln_hm2_15_01":"The door is open! Now, time to put this caper to bed. Deal with him.","pln_hm2_15_02":"The vault is open. Get in there. Finish him. The Dentist is watching.","pln_hm2_15_03":"Drill is done. Time for the Commissar to be done, too. ","pln_hm2_16_03":"And that is the end. Comrade Asshole is dead. Chopper is in-bound. Great work today. The Dentist, and Hoxton, will thank you.","pln_hm2_17_03":"Caught 'em! Now, Commissar is around here somewhere.","pln_hm2_18_02":"Our inside man provided you a handful explosives. Grab it and knock on that door.","pln_hm2_19_01":"The good news: Commissar has a HUGE stash of coke up in his penthouse. The bad news: he's flushing it as fast as he can. That's a lot of money swirling down the crapper - the faster you get there, the bigger the bonus!","pln_hm2_19_03":"Woah, the Commissar has a lot of coke here, but he's employing scorched earth tactics like a true Russian. In other words: He's flushing the product and if you don't get there fast, you miss out on a whole lot of extra income!","pln_hm2_20_03":"Damn! They just flushed another bag of cocaine! Hurry, gang! Get up to the last floor!","pln_hm2_20_05":"More coke just got flushed. That stuff is uncut - it's worth a fortune. Get up there!","pln_hm2_20_10":"Powder's flying like it's a goddamn bakery in there - if you want in, you'd better book it!","pln_hm2_20_11":"Hurry up, they're wasting thousands of dollars worth of coke every damn second!","pln_hm2_20_12":"They're flushing that coke down like their lives depended on it! Hurry up!","pln_hm2_20_13":"They're dumping that coke like the mean it! Get up there and stop them!","pln_hm2_20_15":"Don't get stuck anywhere, keep moving up! It'll be worth it, but it's wasting away quickly!","pln_hm2_20_19":"Throw in another gear, will ya? That pile of coke is getting smaller at an alarming pace!","pln_hm2_20_20":"Run like you mean it! Just kill whoever's in you way, don't waste time and bullets on anyone else!","pln_hm2_20_21":"If you get up there fast enough, we'll make a fortune. Come on! Make an effort!","pln_hm2_21_01":"Aw, this is gonna give me an ulcer, seeing all this coke being flushed and you guys straggling!","pln_hm2_21_04":"Pick up the pace, guys! Every second wasted is money lost! I'm going insane here!","pln_hm2_21_07":"I don't know what's taking you guys so long, but that coke is NOT waiting around for you.","pln_hm2_21_08":"Hell, this coke couldn't get ruined faster if a bomb exploded up in that room! Get! Up! There!","pln_hm2_22_03":"There's not much left now... If you just hurry up you might make a few extra grand.","pln_hm2_22_04":"There's just scraps left now! Even if it's less than I hoped for, it's still extra money, so go for it!","pln_hm2_23_01":"Well! That's the last bag down the pan. Sorry, gang - no extra income this time around.","pln_hm2_24_02":"OK, whatever... There's still another way to win: Find and kill the Commissar! I bet you're motivated now!","pln_hm2_24_03":"Hm... That's sad, but we have not time to lose! Focus on the Commissar now - track him and whack him!","pln_hm2_25_01":"Guys, you're not on a date. Quit strolling and get hustling. Move it!","pln_hm2_25_06":"You're doing this for Hox, so let's get a move on!","pln_hm2_26_01":"What the hell is Commissar working in this room?","pln_hm2_26_04":"Commissar gets his hands dirty with some nasty stuff, including kidnapping.","pln_hm2_26_06":"Dunno what that guy did to piss off the Commissar, but it must have been bad.","pln_hm2_27_03":"Drill that gate, guys.","pln_hm2_28_02":"Looks like they haven't had time to get the wiring behind the wall. Find the switch.","pln_hm2_28_03":"You should be able to track the wires and find a way to open this door.","pln_hm2_29_01":"The staircase is blocked off! There must be a way up nearby!","pln_hm2_29_02":"Staircase's blocked. Gotta be another way up.","pln_hm2_30_02":"Great. Now wait. That rat will be ours soon.","pln_hm2_31_01":"Don't forget to plunder that vault. Haul the loot to the chopper. Always nice to make a little extra money, gentlemen.","pln_hm2_34_01":"There's the coke. Outstanding, guys! Bag as much as you can.","pln_hm2_34_02":"That's the coke, gang. I knew you would do it! Now bag it.","pln_hm2_intro_01_01":"Commissar's gonna be antsy after the motel attack, but he won't be expecting this. Masks on and give the rat what he deserves. Good luck.","pln_hur_01_05":"Work faster!","pln_indif_01_04":"Guys listen. Much more hard-headed opponents on the way!","pln_indif_01_05":"SWAT is stepping up guys. This will get hairy!","pln_indif_01_09":"Bite down. The cops are throwing in another gear. Heavy units moving in!","pln_indif_01_10":"Shit we got bad cops moving in - real bad cops. Keep your heads down!","pln_indif_01_13":"A lot more cops are coming in. Seem to have more weaponry as well.","pln_jewelrystore_stage1_cnc_03":"Juicy score in the diamond district, people. Ice for everyone. ","pln_jewelrystore_stage1_end_01":"The owner of this store will have a month of insurance paperwork to do. Nice take boys, back to the house.","pln_jewelrystore_stage1_end_03":"Nice job snatching all those gems guys. I'll called ahead to my diplomatic contacts - they are hungry for this. Let's feed 'em.","pln_jewelrystore_stage1_end_04":"That was a real pleasure, makes me think of the old days. Starting out small, the simple things, right? Good work.","pln_jewelrystore_stage1_end_07":"OK, I'll get right on fencing this. It won't be hard - this is the perfect kind of merchandise. Nice work!","pln_jewelrystore_stage1_intro_02":"Looks like this store is pretty packed with jewels. Everyone getting ready for the holidays I guess. Anyway, I'm looking for at least four bags of jewels.That ought to cover us nicely.","pln_jewelrystore_stage1_intro_05":"OK, time for a jewelry hit. We need at least six bags. That could prove a challenge - but you guys can do it!","pln_jewelrystore_stage1_intro_06":"OK, time for a jewelry hit. We need at least ten bags. That's kinda crazy - but you guys are good at crazy!","pln_jr1_01_03":"Let em have it, gang!","pln_jr1_02_01":"Find Locke's crates, gang. Look for the ones with the strobe on.","pln_jr1_02_03":"Come on, crew. Locke needs us to find those crates. Show him how we do it.","pln_jr1_03_03":"We better follow Locke's directions on this one. Take the charges to the door.","pln_jr1_04_02":"Sounds a little unhinged. Best do it.","pln_jr1_04_03":"Locke sounds a bit...mad. We'd better do what he says.","pln_jr1_05_01":"There should be a security room close by. Use the arc welder to cut through and green llight the airlock.","pln_jr1_05_02":"Locke wants us to cut through to the security room. Find it, gang, then approve the sequence","pln_jr1_06_01":"Get the bags up to Locke as soon as you can, crew. Look for the large vertical shaft around there.","pln_jr1_06_02":"Find the shaft and zipline those bags up to Locke ASAP.","pln_jr1_07_01":"That's him. Locke.","pln_jr1_08_01":"Locke's escape plan depends on blasting the radars, gang. See to it.","pln_jr1_09_03":"Nicely done, guys. Locke transferred our cut. I don't know about this guy, yet, but let's see how things pan out with him.","pln_jr2_01_01":"Hurry, guys! Into the hold!","pln_jr2_03_01":"Hustle it, guys. You need to get on the ground near the money.","pln_jr2_05_01":"That money needs to be tightly secured by the straps before Locke can take off.","pln_jr2_05_03":"Ensure all of the straps are secure. Don't give Locke an excuse to accidentally drop the money.","pln_jr2_06_01":"The hell he have in mind?","pln_jr2_06_02":"What's he thinking?","pln_jr2_07_03":"You heard what Locke said, guys. Into the boat and let's get out of here.","pln_jr2_intro_01_02":"Hope you're okay up there, crew. Here's Locke.","pln_jwl_03_any_01":"We want at least two bags of jewels from this store. Understand?","pln_jwl_08_any_01":"Check in the back too.","pln_jwl_09_any_01":"Get those bags to the car.","pln_jwl_09_any_02":"Bags to the car people.","pln_jwl_10_any_01":"Almost enough.","pln_jwl_11_any_01":"OK, that's all we need.","pln_jwl_11_any_02":"That's enough for Vlad, but get more if you feel brave.","pln_jwl_11_any_03":"Plenty for Vlad - is it enough for us? Your call.","pln_jwl_12_any_01":"Come on come on, we can do better!","pln_knk_jwl_a_00_003_01":"Get him the tiara and take everything else in the place if you have time... Lot of incidental income you don't want to waste. Just once you decide to make your move, make it fast.","pln_knk_jwl_a_01_any_01":"OK, this is it. Quick in, get Vlad's tiara. You want more, it's your call.","pln_knk_jwl_a_03_any_01":"Halfway mark. Hurry up!","pln_knk_jwl_a_03_any_02":"Halfway mark, people. Hurry it up!","pln_knk_jwl_a_04_any_02":"Got a minute till the van leaves - with or without you.","pln_knk_jwl_a_05_any_01":"30 seconds till the van leaves.","pln_knk_jwl_a_05_any_02":"That's 30 seconds till the van leaves.","pln_knk_jwl_a_06_any_03":"Ten seconds.","pln_knk_jwl_a_07_any_02":"Someone got away.","pln_knk_jwl_a_08_any_01":"There's a good chance there's a security camera in there. Keep an eye out.","pln_knk_jwl_a_09_any_01":"Loot van is on the way. ETA: One minute.","pln_knk_jwl_a_09_any_02":"The wheelman's going to be there in one minute with the escape van.","pln_knk_jwl_a_10_any_01":"The wheelman had to run, too hot. He's relocating.","pln_knk_jwl_a_10_any_02":"Hang tight, too many cops for a pick-up.","pln_knk_jwl_a_10_any_03":"Hang on - too much heat for a pick-up.","pln_knk_jwl_a_11_any_01":"OK, maybe tiara is somewhere nearby. Gotta be in the building.","pln_knk_jwl_a_11_any_02":"Take a look around - Vlad's tiara has to be in there somewhere.","pln_knk_jwl_a_11_any_04":"It has to be there, the tiara is there somewhere.","pln_knk_jwl_a_12_any_01":"Goddammit - they locked you out! Find a way around!","pln_knk_jwl_a_13_any_01":"OK, that's it. Get it to the escape van... Vlad will be pleased.","pln_knk_jwl_a_14_any_04":"We're on the clock, people!","pln_knk_jwl_a_15_any_02":"The escape van just left. I'll get him to come round for another pass but be ready this time.","pln_knk_jwl_a_15_any_04":"Goddammit, you just missed the getaway.","pln_knk_jwl_a_15_any_08":"The getaway just left without you. Sorry guys, you're gonna be spending some time behind bars.","pln_knk_jwl_a_16_any_01":"You guys are looking for a necklace, remember?","pln_knk_jwl_a_16_any_05":"Guys the tiara is probably in a safe or on display somewhere...","pln_ko1b_03_01":"Remember, check the Murkywater shipping containers for the vault.","pln_ko1b_03_02":"Gang, find that vault. It'll be in a shipping container. Probably those Murkywater ones.","pln_ko1b_03_03":"Guys, the vault - find it! Check the Murkywater containers.","pln_ko1b_04_03":"Vlad wants to talk to you...","pln_ko1b_05_02":"These vaults have one weakness. A failsafe will open the door if the temperature inside gets too high. Look around for crowbars in the warehouse, and jam them into the rear fans.","pln_ko1b_06_02":"Look around for crowbars in the warehouse. Stick them into the vault's fans, and wait for thermodynamics to do the rest.","pln_ko1b_07_01":"My guess would be the crowbars are inside the warehouse.","pln_ko1b_07_02":"The warehouse is where you're most likely to find a crowbar.","pln_ko1b_08_02":"Okay, great. The temperature is climbing. Wait it out, but jamming more fans will speed it up.","pln_ko1b_10_01":"That's it for the fans. Temperature is spiking fast. What the hell is in there?","pln_ko1b_10_02":"That's the last fan. Man, look at that temperature climb. I got a bad feeling about this.","pln_ko1b_12_03":"I... uh... okay. So we're boosting nuclear warheads. Guys, be very, very gentle with those things.","pln_ko1b_13_02":"Vlad, smashing malls is one thing. Stealing tiaras is one thing. But nukes!?","pln_ko1b_14_01":"Those warheads are damned heavy. Use the forklifts to shift them.","pln_ko1b_14_02":"Those forklifts will be useful for moving the warheads.","pln_ko1b_15_02":"Look for a way to get to the train quickly. Don't want you guys handling those old Russian nukes longer than you need to.","pln_ko1b_16_01":"That's it. Now you can get the hell out of there, or head back and snag more Murky loot.","pln_ko1b_16_02":"We're done. You can leave that crazy Ivan with his nukes, or head back and grab more loot.","pln_ko1b_16_03":"That's the last one. Now you can get far away, or return to the warehouse for more loot.","pln_ko1b_18_02":"We're done. Now bail! Leave Vlad with his nukes.","pln_ko1b_18_03":"That's the last one. My advice? Get far away, as fast as you can!.","pln_ko1b_brf_01_01":"\"We're hitting the Murkywater warehouse for Vlad. Don't know what the target is, or where it is, but it's tucked away in a vault, which itself is in one of their branded shipping container. Get in there, find the vault and get out whatever it is that crazy Russki wants. Murkies will be on high alert when you get there, and the cops'll be quick to respond, so you gotta get in there and do the job fast. Fast means loud. No tip-toe'ing this one. It's safeties off from the get-go. And, don't forget, there's loot all around. See what you can grab.\"","pln_ko1b_intro_01_02":"Got memories of this place at 4am...","pln_ko1b_intro_01_03":"Lot of activity. Stay frosty.","pln_ko1_01_01":"There it is. Do your thing, guys, but Gage prefers you do it quietly. Front gate is dead ahead, but maybe you can find alternative routes.","pln_ko1_01_02":"There it is, right ahead. Do your thing, guys, but do it quietly. It goes loud, and I'll have to pull you out fast.","pln_ko1_01_03":"That's the depot. You know what you need to do, but keep it quiet. If the alarm goes, I'll have to pull you out.","pln_ko1_02_01":"Look around. Search the Murkywater containers. Just grab any valuables you can.","pln_ko1_04_01":"Used dinars. Hard to trace. Perfect.","pln_ko1_04_03":"A nice stash of used dinars. Good find.","pln_ko1_05_01":"I hope they weren't giving this marching powder to our boys.","pln_ko1_05_02":"This coke won't be funding any more terrorism. Just good old American crime.","pln_ko1_05_03":"Columbian. Bolivian. Mexican. Wherever it's from, it's ours now.","pln_ko1_06_02":"Gold bullion. Probably taken from the enemies of freedom. ","pln_ko1_06_03":"Never get tired of seeing gold bullion getting bagged.","pln_ko1_07_01":"Great work. There's always a market for untraceable guns.","pln_ko1_07_02":"Rifles, pistols and bullets. This will make Gage happy.","pln_ko1_09_01":"Who knows what's on that server. Blueprints, records - maybe the password for Area 51.","pln_ko1_09_03":"I can't wait to see what these shady assholes were hiding on that server.","pln_ko1_11_01":"I think I saw a documentary about that on National Geographic.","pln_ko1_11_02":"People will pay fortunes for this ancient Babylonian shit.","pln_ko1_12_01":"I bet the mad dictator ate off those silver plates.","pln_ko1_12_02":"Saddam had his enemies heads served on that platter.","pln_ko1_14_02":"That'll do for Gage, but you can stay for more.","pln_ko1_15_01":"There's the main gate. Could be watched. Maybe find another way in?","pln_ko1_16_01":"Those Murkywater containers are brought direct from the world's hotspots. Crack them open. They'll be your best bet for loot.","pln_ko1_16_02":"Open those Murkywater containers. If anything has illegal loot, it will be them.","pln_ko1_17_02":"I'm shutting this down. Make sure you're with the driver when he bails, or it's a long walk home.","pln_ko1_18_02":"Why isn't that chopper on any flight plans?","pln_ko1_19_01":"He saw you! Deal with it!","pln_ko1_20_03":"That's bag one. Keep bagging, gang.","pln_ko1_21_02":"You're nearly done. Only one bag to go.","pln_ko1_21_03":"Just the last bag to go, guys. Don't mess up now.","pln_ko1_22_02":"Armor of a Shogun. Nabunaga. Thought lost for centuries, but... here it is. Get the pieces bagged.","pln_ko1_23_01":"I can't believe we scored Oda's armor. Outstanding work!","pln_ko1_24_01":"Gage has arranged for one of the dumpsters to be used to stash some loot. ","pln_ko1_24_02":"There's a dumpster down there. Gage says you can use it to stash some loot.","pln_ko1_25_03":"Gage's guy is in a nearby parking lot. Throw the loot over the wall to him.","pln_ko1_26_01":"Move quick. Guards will notice that open door.","pln_ko1_26_03":"Hustle! The murkies will notice that open vault!","pln_ko1_end_01_02":"That was text-book whisper mode, guys. Great work.","pln_ko1_end_01_03":"Ninja's in socks tiptoeing on thick carpet make more noise than you. Expertly done!","pln_mad_02_02":"You need to disable or destroy the anti-air defenses. Find a way, otherwise we're screwed.","pln_mad_02_03":"Gang, you need to take care of those anti-air guns ASAP. Find a way!","pln_mad_04_01":"Hook up the laptop to the anti-aircraft gun!","pln_mad_05_03":"Okay, give me a minute or two. I'll disable this AA gun.","pln_mad_08_02":"I bet you there are some explosives laying around here. See if you can find any.","pln_mad_09_02":"Plant the C4 and enjoy the moment.","pln_mad_09_03":"Place the C4.","pln_mad_10_01":"Stand back, gang!","pln_mad_10_02":"Take cover!","pln_mad_10_03":"They are about to blow, stand back!","pln_mad_11_02":"Perfect! They won't be able to use that anymore.","pln_mad_13_01":"Nice drop, Bile! Gang, the EMP is in the yard outside the lumber mill.","pln_mad_13_03":"The EMP has been dropped. Head over just outside the lumber mill and pick it up.","pln_mad_14_01":"Ok, gang. We need to find a way into the lumber mill. This might be crazy, but maybe we could use the anti-air gun we hacked earlier? Just redirect its position and blow the wall up?","pln_mad_15_01":"Hell yeah! That was crazy, gang! Now get in there.","pln_mad_15_02":"That's how we do it! Good job, guys. Get inside the mill now.","pln_mad_17_02":"Protect the EMP! The mercenaries will do anything to stop you!","pln_mad_17_03":"Gang, you need to protect the EMP while it charges! Prepare to fight!","pln_mad_18_01":"Damn it, they stopped the charge!","pln_mad_19_01":"The mercenaries interrupted the EMP charge! Every time that happens, the EMP is slowly discharged!","pln_mad_20_02":"Good, the EMP is charging again.","pln_mad_21_03a":"But just stick to the plan and we should be good. Get inside the laboratory through the hatch and find the scanner and the test-subjects.","pln_mad_22_01":"Gang? I'm not sure you can hear me, but you know what you're supposed to do: enter the laboratory via the hatchet.","pln_mad_22_03":"That's it! The EMP did its job! Now enter the laboratory via the hatch.","pln_mad_22_04":"Guys, can you hear me? Hello? Enter the laboratory via the hatch. It should be open.","pln_mad_24_02":"What the hell! The whole room is filled with gas. Quickly! Find out where it's coming from and find a way to shut it off!","pln_mad_24_03":"Damn it! The bastards have filled the room with gas to stop us. Gang, be quick and find a way to shut it off!","pln_mad_25_01":"You need to find a way to shut off the gas.","pln_mad_25_03":"There must be some way to shut off the gas!","pln_mad_26_01":"Good job, guys. That should get rid of the gas in the scanning room.","pln_mad_26_03":"Good, that should get rid of the gas. You can most likely enter the room now.","pln_mad_27_02":"Damn it to hell! What is wrong with a traditional security door that you can drill? Looks like you're gonna need the actual lead scientist for hand print authorization. Find him.","pln_mad_28_03":"Look for the lead scientist and get him to the security door. ","pln_mad_29_02":"Damn! They killed the lead scientist? I don't know, guys.

Nothing special. Find the manager's office, contain the crowd, make sure we leave in one piece. ","pln_nightclub_stage1_brief_01b":"Oh, and there are probably rival Russian mobsters here. I know, Vlad is not being forthcoming with me either.","pln_nightclub_stage1_end_a_01":"Wow. Russians would call this tactic scorched earth. Very aggressive. I'm sure Vlad will pour you a shot of vodka in thanks. ","pln_nightclub_stage1_end_a_02":"Cops bloodied our nose on that one - somehow I think Vlad was holding back information... As usual. But you did well... Let's see what old Vlad tells us. ","pln_nightclub_stage1_end_a_04":"Disco inferno. Nicely done. Let's get paid.","pln_nightclub_stage1_end_b_01":"You can dance, I will give you that. Good work. Get the money here and let's talk with Vlad.","pln_nightclub_stage1_end_b_03":"No cop could have seen  this one coming. Perfect. The Russians are going to be pissed and Vlad will OD on vodka.

If you get any phone numbers, I don't want to know.","pln_nightclub_stage1_intro_a_03":"Vlad is probably right about the police being quick on the draw here. Get in and get out fast after you empty that manager's safe. And Wolf, stay off the dance floor.

They're gonna lock it down, now!","pln_nmh_60_01":"Good, that's a security door stopped. See if our patient is inside.","pln_nmh_61_01":"If that's the wrong room, we'll have to cut the other doors with a saw. We gotta get that blood sample...","pln_nmh_62_02":"Do them one by one, and keep the cops away.","pln_nmh_63_02":"OK, it's done. Go have a look at the patient.","pln_nmh_64_01":"You'll know if it's the right guy, 'cause he has a tattoo on his neck.","pln_nmh_64_02":"Our patient should have a tattoo on his neck.","pln_nmh_65_02":"Ok, now get a blood sample from the target.","pln_nmh_65_03":"There you go, that's him. Start drawing some blood.","pln_nmh_66_01":"Wrong guy, keep looking!","pln_nmh_66_02":"That's not our guy.","pln_nmh_68_01":"We need a viral concentration of 65% or more.","pln_nmh_69_01":"We're gonna need two vials.

You'll have to get another one, guys.","pln_nmh_71_02":"The concentration in that sample wasn't even close. You need to go again.","pln_nmh_71_03":"Crap, not good enough. Get another one.","pln_nmh_71_04":"Still not enough, you need to take another sample.","pln_nmh_72_02":"Was that a vial breaking?

Both of them. Then you get the hell out.","pln_nmh_88_01":"You gotta get more blood into that cooler, guys.","pln_nmh_88_02":"One more sample in the cooler before you can leave.","pln_nmh_90_01":"That's the elevator.

Got a feeling this job is gonna come back from the dead to haunt us.","pln_pal_01_01":"We're here for the plates. They've been printing fortunes over the last months, spending wildly. Blood's in the water and we're the sharks!","pln_pal_01_02":"Guys, we're after the counterfeit money plates. Supposed to be stashed in the basement. Get friendly with Mitchell and get them.","pln_pal_01_03":"Okay, we got a free lunch here. These guys are printing money in the basement. We're going to relieve them of their plates.

That's our man.","pln_pal_04_02":"Alright, nobody stay underground.","pln_pal_04_03":"All right. Try and keep out of sight. It's all about control.","pln_pal_04_04":"Keep things cool. Don't give the nosey neighbours something to talk about.","pln_pal_04_05":"Okay gang. Watch your step.

They'll be here soon.","pln_pal_05_02":"Someone must've seen something 'cause the police are sending a couple of officers to check out the address.","pln_pal_05_03":"Just picked up a call to a cop patrol. They've been asked to make sure everything's okay. They're on their way.","pln_pal_06_01":"That's the door, and there's the code lock. See if you can override the system.","pln_pal_06_03":"A white MESA box, just as planned. Get the code breakers going on the locks.","pln_pal_07_01":"Get a code breaker on that lock, too.","pln_pal_07_03":"That's the second lock. Get the codebreaker on it too.","pln_pal_08a_01":"Ok, now find Wilson's code lock.","pln_pal_08a_02":"Now do the same to the second code lock.","pln_pal_08_03":"Okay, looks like they have two linked locks on this. Find the other lock and get a breaker on it too.","pln_pal_10_01":"Ok, make sure the codebreaker doesn't stall, they got a pretty secure system here. Guess you just can't be too careful these days","pln_pal_11_01":"Ok, the cops are here to investigate. If you let them inside the house and take 'em out quietly, we'll remain under the radar.","pln_pal_12_01":"Keep going guys - no one's seen you yet.","pln_pal_12_02":"The cops seem to think you're still in the house, we got a small time window now!","pln_pal_12_04":"Keep going guys, we're still undetected.","pln_pal_14_01":"Pick up the phone or they'll know something is off.","pln_pal_15_02":"Some more cops have been called in. Be prepared! ","pln_pal_15_03":"They have called in another car. Take care of it. ","pln_pal_17_01":"Who fired? You guys are made now. Go to plan B!","pln_pal_17_02":"Their neighborhood surely heard that gunshot!","pln_pal_18_01":"That noise... Ahh some suspicious neighbours called the cops!","pln_pal_19_01":"Don't go near the neighbours houses.","pln_pal_19_02":"Don't go to the neighbours.","pln_pal_19_04":"Stay on the lot, guys.

The cops are reported missing and they're sending in a SWAT team. The party just got started.","pln_pal_22_03":"Damn. Those patrol men? Looks like they're buddies are coming to find them. Coming in force!","pln_pal_23_02":"Ah we're made. We go to plan B! Lock it down and get the stuff done.","pln_pal_24_01":"Wow, the police are calling for heavy reinforcement. They'll be here any moment!","pln_pal_24_02":"Florida cops don't mess around. They want to make a good first impression.

","pln_pal_29_01":"Apparently that's a Franz Jaeger Safe. That lock cannot be drilled, and the entire safe is heavily reinforced. I ran into one of those back in the days. We filled the safe with water and detonated a bit of C4 inside. The water pressure just threw the door open without damaging any of the content inside the safe.","pln_pal_29_02":"Hey, that's a Franz-Jaeger Safe. This is unexpected. Well, only one way to crack it with the time we got. Water pressure!","pln_pal_29_03":"Man, these boys got themselves a Franz-Jaeger safe. Wasn't expecting that! Okay....well, with what we got there's only one way we're cracking that - water!","pln_pal_30_01":"So the plan is this, drill a hole through the top of the safe, get a garden hose to fill the safe with water and drop some C4 inside. After that you take what's inside the safe and escape. Let's roll.","pln_pal_30_03":"I run into one of those back in the days. We fill the safe with water and detonated a bit of C4 inside. The water pressure threw the door open without damaging any of the content inside the safe.","pln_pal_31_01":"Alright. Now apply the drill to that safe and drag the garden hose down into the shelter.","pln_pal_31_02":"First, get the drill onto the safe, make a little hole. Then we need to fill the safe with water. The garden hose will do.","pln_pal_31_03":"Alright, here's what you do. Get a drill onto the safe. Make a hole in it. Then, we need to fill it with water. Drag the garden hose down.","pln_pal_32_02":"Get drilling the safe, crew.","pln_pal_32_03":"Guys, don't forget to drill the safe.","pln_pal_32_05":"Let me remind you - drill the safe!","pln_pal_33_01":"Ok the drill is up and running!","pln_pal_34_01":"Almost there guys, just wait for the drill to finish!","pln_pal_34_02":"Almost there, just wait for the drill to finish.","pln_pal_35_01":"Great! Start dragging that garden hose!","pln_pal_36_02":"You need to drag the water hose down into the shelter.","pln_pal_36_03":"Get the water hose connected to the safe!","pln_pal_36_05":"Go lay down the water hose, move it!","pln_pal_36_07":"Now grab the hose and pull it down to the safe.","pln_pal_37_01":"Fill her up good, guys!","pln_pal_37_02":"Alright, the hose is laid out.","pln_pal_37_03":"The hose is laid out, good job.","pln_pal_38_01":"Get the water hose and connect it to the safe!","pln_pal_38_02":"Connect the garden hose to the safe.","pln_pal_39_02":"Turn on that water hose!","pln_pal_39_05":"Turn the water on!","pln_pal_39_06":"Now let the water flow!","pln_pal_40_02":"The police shut of the main water pipe. You gotta get it running again!","pln_pal_40_03":"The cops turned of the water. Get the main valve turned on, it's in the street!","pln_pal_41_03":"That's the valve. Open it!","pln_pal_42_02":"We need to get the water running again!","pln_pal_42_08":"Turn the water back on!","pln_pal_43_02":"I just heard that the police will make a second opening in Wilson's house!","pln_pal_44_03":"These Florida cops don't mess around. They smashed right through Wilson's wall!","pln_pal_46_01":"SWATS are driving in over the hills, from the south east.","pln_pal_46_02":"SWATS are coming in from the south, by the beach!","pln_pal_46_03":"SWATS riding up by the beach!","pln_pal_47_01":"SWATS coming in from the east!","pln_pal_47_02":"I see SWAT vans rolling into the neighbourhood coming from the east. Dig in!","pln_pal_48_01":"SWATS from the west!","pln_pal_48_03":"We got cops moving in from the west. Watch em!","pln_pal_49_03":"They've rigged the place with C4!","pln_pal_50_03":"It's a trap! Out!","pln_pal_51a_01":"Oh, my god!","pln_pal_51a_03":"Jesus...christ.....","pln_pal_51b_02":"You guys there?!","pln_pal_51_02":"Guys!","pln_pal_51_03":"Heads down!","pln_pal_52_01":"Fantastic! You defused all of em'. Get the money.","pln_pal_52_02":"That was not a bomb shelter either, just concrete and plaster walls, C4 I must say was a bit.. overkill.","pln_pal_53_01":"At least the safe is intact.","pln_pal_53_03":"Check the safe!","pln_pal_53_04":"Yeah, the safe is here.","pln_pal_54_01":"You got some! Not half bad!","pln_pal_54_02":"That's a great bonus you got there!","pln_pal_54_03":"Check out those money stacks, must be a good print. Worth a fortune on the streets.","pln_pal_55_02":"At least we got the cash before it blew!","pln_pal_55_03":"Ha! At least you grabbed the money before the bang!","pln_pal_56_01":"Our money's still burning. That's sad sad sad...","pln_pal_57_02":"Ok, drop the C4 into the safe and blow it open, the water will do the trick.","pln_pal_57_03":"Ok, drop the dynamite in the safe and blow it, the water will do the trick!","pln_pal_58_01":"Plant the charge on the safe.","pln_pal_58_03":"Now drop the C4 in. Detonate it and the pressure inside will blow it wide open...","pln_pal_59a_01":"Check the area all around the safe.","pln_pal_59a_02":"Remember - the explosion may have scattered the loot across the floor.","pln_pal_59a_03":"Remember - the explosive might have thrown the loot across the room.","pln_pal_60_01":"Fantastic! Now don't scratch it! ","pln_pal_60_02":"You got it. Now get it out - safely!","pln_pal_61_01":"Gang, you see those plates? I don't want to be greedy; or yes I do, actually. Why not stick around just a bit and try that printer out? ","pln_pal_62_01":"You see that sweet money printer under the pool? I'm sure we can use it to gain an extra mountain of cash! Get it working. ","pln_pal_62_03":"Guys, check out the printing press. Whaddya say we make a little extra cash while we're here...literally make it!","pln_pal_63_03":"All that printing press needs is paper and ink. Cha-ching! Instant cash!","pln_pal_64_01":"Guys, the printer is out of paper! Fill her up! ","pln_pal_65_01":"Dammit, the ink seems to have run out! Replace it!","pln_pal_67_01":"Cops shut of the power, go to the box in the street .","pln_pal_67_02":"The cops shut off the power, turn it back on!","pln_pal_68_01":"The cops shut you down. You gotta find the electricity box.","pln_pal_68_02":"Cops cut the power, you gotta find the electricity box and turn it back on.","pln_pal_68_03":"Ah, no - the cops cut the power. Find a circuit box inside the buildings and turn it back on.","pln_pal_69_01":"You need to get the power back up.","pln_pal_69_03":"Get the power back on!","pln_pal_70_01":"Okay, the electricity is back, now just start the printer again","pln_pal_70_02":"Ok, power's back - restart the printer!","pln_pal_70_03":"Ok, the powers back on!","pln_pal_72_01":"Great, now start the money maker.","pln_pal_72_02":"Both ink and paper roll are in.

Well done. We got enough meth to deal with Hector. Let's get back in town. ","pln_rat_stage1_end_b_02":"My crew, all master chefs. You got so much product out of that cook we should all break bad and do this full time!","pln_rat_stage1_end_b_03":"Deal's on, people. You made enough crystal to make royalty blush. Hector's going to be singing your praises if he isn't high as a kite. Well done.","pln_rat_stage1_end_c_03":"We came up a little short. Let's just play along and try to solve the Rat problem for Hector another way. We're inventive...","pln_rat_stage1_intro_a_01":"Straight ahead and to the right, you'll see an old two story house. Surprise, surprise, this is cook central. ","pln_rat_stage1_intro_a_01b":"Get in, save Hector's cooks and get the drugs out of there before anything else goes wrong.","pln_rat_stage1_intro_a_02":"The lab, if you can call an rundown dump like this a lab, is straight ahead.

Which is where you come in... Trade the meth with them for the info.","pln_rat_stage2_end_a_02":"I guess they cared more about their fix than information. Junkies aren't great with abstraction. Meanwhile the Mendozas are leaving for the airport in a rented bus, escorted by undercover FBI. ","pln_rat_stage2_end_c_01b":"Mendozas are headed for the airport. Bring that briefcase. I bet we can figure out something to do with it.","pln_rat_stage2_end_d_01":"That was like Baghdad all over again. You need to roll. Hector's got a line on the Mendozas on their way to the airport. We're gonna hit their convoy like a ten ton hammer.","pln_rat_stage2_intro_a_01":"OK, remember, this should stay peaceful. Trade the meth for the info, surplus meth for cash. Easy and clean, walk away without bloodshed.

OK? OK.","pln_rat_stage2_intro_a_03b":"Let's just get it over with and hopefully without bloodshed. We have enough of that ahead of us.","pln_rat_stage3_04_any_01":"That's the bus, take them all out.","pln_rat_stage3_06_any_01":"I'm sending a chopper in for you guys to unload the loot.

The Mendozas are out of business and their liquidity is riding shotgun in our chopper. Sweet.","pln_rat_stage3_end_c_02":"That's a relief, you aced this one.

Let's see if Hector's going to throw us a party, shall we?","pln_rat_stage3_intro_a_03":"OK, the Mendoza bus is on the bridge, which means we land to take it out in ten minutes. Hit the bus, finish off their people, take the money. Simple.","pln_rt1b_01_01":"Damn, looks like the cops had been staking the place. Move it!","pln_rt1b_02_01":"Running low on ingredients? If you want to stay and cook a little more, there's a supply drop waiting in the wings for you... Just signal the helicopter. Or you can bail now. Your choice.","pln_rt1b_02_03":"This place is running low on supplies. If you wanna go for more ingredients, signal the chopper with a flare. This pilot's on the clock, so make it worth while.

You've got to fight them off and stop them from taking your hard-earned money.","pln_sfr_kb1_01":"You've got to keep at least 1 bag!","pln_sfr_kb4_01":"You've got to keep at least 4 bags!","pln_sfr_kb5_01":"You've got to keep at least 5 bags!","pln_sfr_kb6_01":"You've got to keep at least 6 bags!","pln_sfr_kb8_01":"You've got to keep at least 8 bags!","pln_sh11_00_01":"Yeah yeah, just put on your mask now.","pln_sh11_01_03":"That fence over there is your way in. Cut it open.","pln_sh11_02_01":"Now keep moving. And as much as you hate this, this is still a real thing. You get discovered you'll trigger the alarm.","pln_sh11_03_01":"Your instincts are correct my friend. You'll have to take him out.","pln_sh11_03_02":"Nice to see you still have a keen observation. Take him out and do it quick.","pln_sh11_03_03":"Yeah, I agree. You'll have to take him out.","pln_sh11_04_01":"Quick! Answer his pager and make some crap up.","pln_sh11_05_02":"Great. Bag that body and get it out of sight before someone sees it.","pln_sh11_06_01":"Dallas, come on, you're standing next to a dumpster.","pln_sh11_06_02":"How about that dumpster?","pln_sh11_07_01":"You're done? Good. Now keep going.","pln_sh11_08_01":"There's another guard. Stay out of sight.","pln_sh11_09_03":"Yeah, you're not getting past that guy without too much risk. Take him out.","pln_sh11_10_01":"Don't forget to hide the body.","pln_sh11_11_01":"A contact of mine stashed a few body bags nearby just in case.","pln_sh11_11_02":"A contact of mine has stashed a few body bags nearby if you need more.","pln_sh11_11_03":"There's a few body bags stashed nearby.","pln_sh11_12_01":"Remember, you'll have to pay for these kinds of \"special\" favors in the future. My contacts don't work for free.","pln_sh11_12_03":"I got your back this time, but in the future you'll have to pay for these kinds of \"special\" favors. My contacts are good people and they expect good money in return.","pln_sh11_13_01":"All right, head back and get that body out of the open.","pln_sh11_13_02":"Now get back and hide that body.","pln_sh11_14_01":"Damn! Someone saw the body! Take him out before he calls it in!","pln_sh11_14_02":"Damn! Someone must have found the body! Take him out before he sounds the alarm!","pln_sh11_15_02":"Good job. You reacted fast. Time to dispose of the bodies.","pln_sh11_16_01":"Behind those crates should do. Now, get the other guy. Remember to grab another body bag.","pln_sh11_16_02":"Hiding them behind those crates should be good enough. Don't forget a body bag for the other guy.","pln_sh11_17_01":"Okay, with that mess taken care of, it's time to find the server room.","pln_sh11_18_01":"God dammit! Another guy, and this one's watching the server room. I guess you have to take him out as well.","pln_sh11_19_01":"The Control-Guy seems to be a real dumbwit but we can't fool him forever. I'm betting he's sounding the alarm next time.","pln_sh11_19_03":"We're lucky that Control-Guy is stupid as hell, but he's getting suspicious. Next time he'll most likely sound the alarm.","pln_sh11_21_01":"Do you see the flash drive? It should be in a laptop or something.","pln_sh11_21_03":"Now, find the encrypted flash drive we came for. It should be in a laptop.","pln_sh11_22_01":"Excellent. Now, remember to steal something. We need to make it look like a clean-cut robbery and nothing else.","pln_sh11_22_02":"Great. Now find something else to steal. We need to make it look like a simple robbery.","pln_sh11_23_01":"Yeah, yeah, we got what we came for.","pln_sh11_23_02":"Good find. That will certainly do.","pln_sh11_23_03":"Excellent. We're almost done. Bear with me.","pln_sh11_24_02":"Be real careful now. Another guard is patrolling the area, probably looking for his partners. Do not kill this guy, you hear me? Do NOT kill him.","pln_sh11_25_01":"If you see a target you can \"spot\" it to keep track of its movements.","pln_sh11_25_02":"You can \"spot\" targets to keep track of them.","pln_sh11_26_01":"I know I'm sounding like a broken record, but don't kill him. You won't be able to trick the Control-Guy again if you try answering the pager.","pln_sh11_27_01":"Careful. Wait for him to move.","pln_sh11_28_01":"Don't rush it. Just let him pass then you can move.","pln_sh11_28_02":"Easy now, Speedy Gonzales. Hang back and let him pass first.","pln_sh11_28_03":"Wait for him to pass then you can move.","pln_sh11_29_01":"Dallas, my man. You still got it. Now, throw the loot in the back of the van and let's get the hell out of here.","pln_sh11_29_03":"Good job, Dallas. You still have it in you. Now, throw the loot in the van and let's leave.","pln_sh11_30_03":"It was a bit of a bumpy ride, but it turned out a-ok. We got the flash drive and the gold as a bonus. It should give you some nice cash to get started again.","pln_sh11_31_03":"Shit, the alarm went off! This heist is over. Try and escape before the big guns arrive. Hurry!","pln_sh11_cbf_01_01":"Break into the Police storage compound and get your hands on some access codes we will need later.","pln_sh11_cbf_01_03":"Your job is to break into a Police storage compound and look for some access codes that we will be needing later.","pln_sh11_intro_01_01":"All right, this is the place. Remember, we're here for the access codes.","pln_sh12_01_02":"Time to show me some more of your stealthy skills. The rest of you wait by the van and keep a lookout if things would turn south.","pln_sh12_01_03":"The database should be on the second floor of the building.","pln_sh12_02_01":"Forget about the main entrance. Put on your mask and cut through that fence instead.","pln_sh12_03_03":"The main entrance would be suicide. We're sneaking in from the side instead by cutting open that fence.","pln_sh12_04_01":"I'm not taking any chances. Now, get that door open.","pln_sh12_04_03":"You get to make a lot of money if you do as I say. Now, proceed inside and get that door open.","pln_sh12_05_01":"Use your ECM Jammer and disable it. That will give you the time needed to lockpick the door.","pln_sh12_06_03":"I don't get what you're doing. You need to get rid of that camera. Just do as I say and deploy the ECM Jammer","pln_sh12_07_01":"Good. Now, try lock picking that door.","pln_sh12_07_03":"Nice. With the camera out of the way, you can safely lock pick that door.","pln_sh12_08_02":"Why did you shoot it? I told you to use the ECM Jammer...","pln_sh12_08_03":"That was unnecesssary, Dallas... Destroying cameras will not go unnoticed.","pln_sh12_09_01":"This is what happens when you're away from the life of crime for too long.","pln_sh12_09_02":"Gensec have upped their game, that's for sure.","pln_sh12_10_01":"Damn! Incoming security guard outside! Deal with him before he sees the broken camera and triggers the alarm!","pln_sh12_10_02":"Dallas! There's a security guard outside and he's gonna see the broken camera. Take him out before he calls it in!","pln_sh12_10_03":"Get back out again! There's a security guard outside that will spot the broken camera. Deal with him fast before he sounds the alarm!","pln_sh12_11_01":"Good. Now answer his pager and hide the body in that dumpster.","pln_sh12_11_02":"Good job. Answer the pager and then hide the body in the dumpster.","pln_sh12_12_01":"Now get back inside and look for the computer.","pln_sh12_13_03":"Sneak by it and look for the security room. If we do that, we can disable all cameras at once.","pln_sh12_14_01":"Act fast now! Answer the pager and hide the body in that janitor closet","pln_sh12_14_03":"Hurry and answer that pager, then hide the body in that janitor closet.","pln_sh12_15_01":"Ok, see if you can find that keycard.","pln_sh12_16_01":"Stay under the cameras and they wont be able to spot you.","pln_sh12_16_02":"Remember to sneak under the cameras so they won't spot you.","pln_sh12_16_03":"Keep your head down and avoid the cameras.","pln_sh12_17_01":"Use the keycard you picked up to open the door. But, be ready to quickly take out anyone inside.","pln_sh12_17_03":"Use the keycard you picked up and enter the room. Just be ready to silence anyone inside.","pln_sh12_18_01":"Answer the pager and we should be fine. The cameras won't present any more trouble.","pln_sh12_18_02":"Hurry up and answer the pager.","pln_sh12_18_03":"Get that pager call and we should be good.","pln_sh12_19_02":"That console panel should control all the cameras. Give it a go and see if you can find the computer we're after.","pln_sh12_20_03":"Good! Get your ass over there and start the hacking.","pln_sh12_21_01":"Just try and sneak past him. Don't rush it.","pln_sh12_21_03":"You don't want to get detected when we've come this far. Try and sneak past him.","pln_sh12_22_01":"Put in the flash drive and get started.","pln_sh12_22_03":"Time to use the flash drive.","pln_sh12_23_01":"Perfect! Now, give it a few seconds and we should be done.","pln_sh12_24_01":"Grab the USB flash drive and get outta there. And, Dallas, don't get sloppy here.","pln_sh12_24_02":"Get the flash drive and leave. And, Dallas, don't let them see you on the way out.","pln_sh12_24_03":"Bring the flash drive with you and get out of there.","pln_sh12_25_01":"Well done, Dallas. Head to the van and get out of there.","pln_sh12_25_02":"You did good, Dallas. Now, get to the van and get out of there. ","pln_sh12_25_03":"Job well done, Dallas. The van's waiting for you.","pln_sh12_26_02":"They saw you! God damn it!","pln_sh12_26_03":"Damn it, Dallas! You've been spotted!","pln_sh12_27_01":"Look what a nice guy I am. I had one of my contacts stash more body bags for you.","pln_sh12_27_03":"Make sure you grab an extra body bag. My treat this time.","pln_sh12_28_02":"Dallas! What are you doing? If you keep destroying cameras, they'll send more guards!","pln_sh12_29_01":"Damn it, Dallas! I told you to wait for me to say you should use the ECM!","pln_sh12_29_02":"What the hell, Dallas? I told you not to use the ECM until I said so!","pln_sh12_30_01":"That was some damn good sneaking, Dallas. I am impressed.","pln_sh12_30_03":"It looks like Dallas still has what it takes to perform heists in the big leagues!","pln_sh12_intro_01_02":"We're here. Time to get your sneak-on.","pln_sh21_01_01":"Remember, don't put on the mask. Case the place first.","pln_sh21_02_02":"These civvies have their own lives to think about as long as you don't scare them.","pln_sh21_02_03":"These civilians don't get paid enough to care about your business. Don't scare them.","pln_sh21_03_01":"The manager's office is where the coke is, but watch out for mobsters.","pln_sh21_03_03":"You'll find the coke in the manager's office but it will be guarded, so stay on your toes.","pln_sh21_04_01":"Take him out, or try and get by him unnoticed.","pln_sh21_04_02":"That's one of the mobsters. Sneak or kill: Your choice.","pln_sh21_04_03":"You got two options: Sneak by him or take him down. ","pln_sh21_05_01":"Okay, yeah. You're not getting past that guy without taking him down. It's show time.","pln_sh21_05_03":"That guy won't move on his own, so that means it's time to force him. ","pln_sh21_06_02":"And down they go. Okay, I'm betting the cocaine is in that safe so it's time to drill.","pln_sh21_07_01":"Take a look around the office while you wait for the drill. Might be some other loot we can take.","pln_sh21_07_02":"See if you can find anything of interest while waiting for the drill to finish.","pln_sh21_08_02":"Dallas! The cops are here, you know what to do!","pln_sh21_09_01":"Holy...! They setup a sniper in the building across the street! Keep your head down and take him out!","pln_sh21_09_03":"The cops brought in a Sniper! He's in the building across the street. Take your aim and take him out!","pln_sh21_10_02":"The SWAT-team is here! Dallas, you need to take 'em out!","pln_sh21_10_03":"The bastards called in the SWAT-team! Okay, Dallas, show me you're no god damn rookie and take them down!","pln_sh21_cbf_01_01":"Get inside the nightclub and retrieve the stolen cocaine.","pln_sh21_cbf_01_02":"This is an easy one. Get in, get the coke, and get out.","pln_sh21_intro_01_02":"We're at the night club. Time to get your dance-on. Start by \"casing\" the place before the fun begins. Take a look around first and keep things casual.","pln_sh22_01_02":"I'm getting a helicopter to pick you up, but it's gonna take some time.","pln_sh22_01_03":"I'm calling in a helicopter to pick you up!","pln_sh22_02_02":"Heads up, the SWAT-team is here! ","pln_sh22_02_03":"The bastards called in the SWAT-team! Give 'em hell!","pln_sh22_03_01":"Don't just stand around! Help your teammate up!","pln_sh22_03_02":"Your teammate is down! Help him!","pln_sh22_03_03":"Your buddy needs your help! Go!","pln_sh22_04_01":"Don't forget the coke in the van, or all of this would be for nothing!","pln_sh22_04_03":"Dallas! Get the cocaine from the van before the cops!","pln_sh22_06_01":"Excellent. Now, take the hostage to the back, away from the cops.","pln_sh22_06_02":"Too many bullets flyin' here! Get the hostage to the room in the back.","pln_sh22_06_03":"Okay, good. Now, take the hostage to the room in the back.","pln_sh22_07_03":"I'll negotiate a deal with the cops, so we can get our friend back. You just sit tight.","pln_sh22_08_02":"All right, I made the deal. Un-cuff the hostage so we can get our teammate back.","pln_sh22_09_02":"OK, take this time to heal up. Drop the cocaine and put down a doctor bag.","pln_sh22_10_01":"Good. Now, don't forget to pick up the coke again.","pln_sh22_10_02":"Nothing some meds can't fix. Pick up the cocaine now.","pln_sh22_10_03":"Okay, you should be fit for fight again. Grab the cocaine.","pln_sh22_11_02":"Time to go. No time for lock-picking, just shoot off the door handle.","pln_sh22_11_03":"OK, time to leave. Don't lock-pick that door, just blow off the door handle.","pln_sh22_12_01":"Wait! Don't shoot that cop, he's alone! Intimidate him to work for us instead!","pln_sh22_13_01":"Time to head for the roof where the helicopter will pick you up!","pln_sh22_14_03":"Heads up! SWAT!","pln_sh22_15_01":"Watch out, Sniper!","pln_sh22_15_02":"Sniper! Take cover!","pln_sh22_15_03":"They brought in a Sniper!","pln_sh22_16_02":"Damn, that's a SHIELD! Try and get behind him!","pln_sh22_17_01":"Helicopter's there now! Throw in the coke!","pln_sh22_18_01":"That's it! Time to go! You still got it, Dallas!","pln_sh_int_03_01":"There is a room behind the kitchen, go there, I've prepared the starting kit for you.","pln_sh_int_04_01":"I got the pre-order kit in the back for you. Go get it!","pln_sh_int_05_01":"There we go, now put your mask on.","pln_sh_int_06_01":"OK, I trust you hear me loud and clear. Alright, we don't have any time to waste, let's just get to it.","pln_sh_int_07_01":"First of all, besides from that starter kit, another package is awaiting you in the back alley.","pln_sh_int_08_01":"My accomplice will assist you. He's waiting.","pln_sh_int_09_01":"Look up.","pln_sh_int_14_01":"Pick it up. It's your money that I laundered. Some extra in there for your generous contribution to OVERKILL.","pln_sh_int_16_01":"Alright, count that up.","pln_sh_int_17_01":"Cool - 25 large. Spend them well.","pln_sh_int_18_01":"OK that should be 5k to start with. ","pln_sh_int_19_01":"Some cash, look at it as a welcome gift to get you started. I expect you will pull in much more.","pln_sh_int_20_01":"Don't worry, no one will hear you back here. But keep it down to be safe...","pln_sh_int_21_01":"Now, pick up the money.","pln_sh_int_23_01":"So, as you surely know, this isn't everything this safe house has to offer, let me show you what I'm working on.","pln_sh_int_24_01":"I know you want to get out there and start working, but I have to make sure you know the drill. Times change, new equipment, new toys. I just want to make sure you got it all in check.","pln_sh_int_27_01":"Gentlemen... Welcome to your safe house.","pln_sh_int_28_01":"OK, to your left is your Crime.net station. This is where you get your contracts. To your right are your security cameras. Look around and I'll tell you more.","pln_sh_int_29_01":"Yeah, straight ahead there is your own private vault. We're gonna stack that up.","pln_sh_int_30_01":"Down there - your own vault. To the right is your camera system. Left your Crime.net station. Let's roll.","pln_sh_int_31_01":"Welcome to Crime.net. This is your crime community. I will hook you up with crime contacts all over DC looking for guys like you. This net is built on mutual trust and money.","pln_sh_int_31_01b":"We've been growing this for over two years. There should be plenty of new contacts for you to make on your own as well.","pln_sh_int_32_01":"You got a new contact. His name is Vlad. Look him up on Crime.net and let's see what he can set us up with.","pln_sh_int_33_01":"New contact on Crime.net, guys. Got a shady politician with ambition. We call him The Elephant for now. Look him up.","pln_sh_int_34_01":"Your Crime.net is updated. There is a heavy duty drug cartel head in town. His name his Hector Moralez. Look him up.","pln_sh_int_36_01":"Doors. You can try these out too. Keep in mind that there are lots of ways to get one open. In our line of work, closing doors is pointless - opening 'em is what matters.","pln_sh_int_41_01":"I know this is elementary for you, but practice is practice, right?","pln_sh_int_44_01":"Good luck - those things are tricky.","pln_sh_int_45_01":"In the field, if you trip an alarm, the cops come buzzing. DC's got a lot of them.","pln_sh_int_49_01":"Oh yeah. Pagers. ","pln_sh_int_50_01":"Tricky business. Gensec started mandating everyone wear 'em.","pln_sh_int_51_01":"I set up a little test case for you to see how these work.","pln_sh_int_52_01":"You'll wanna answer the pager before too long.","pln_sh_int_54_01":"Living on borrowed time, as it were.","pln_sh_int_55_01":"But hell, if you're good - that's the edge you need.","pln_sh_int_56_01":"Now if you're a good liar... That's a whole other ballgame.","pln_sh_int_57_01":"Oh. The best room in the safe house. The vault.","pln_sh_int_58_01":"Your money is here. Your spendable cash is piled on that table.","pln_sh_int_60_01":"For now, just enjoy the view. We'll put more in here, I promise.","pln_sh_int_62_01":"Otherwise, any questions? I'm sure you can figure out the rest. Feel free to come here whenever you want.","pln_sh_int_65_01":"Here's your mask area. Pretty self-explanatory.","pln_sh_int_66_01":"Of course you can customize masks like you can customize weapons.","pln_sh_int_67_01":"We'll hang all your completed masks right here. ","pln_sh_int_70_01":"I love this place. Cops don't swing by too often.","pln_sh_int_71_01":"Keep a low profile though. Never know who is looking.","pln_sh_int_73_01":"Hit the Crime.net station to get out of here.","pln_sh_int_73_02":"Go hit up Crime.net when you are ready.","pln_sh_int_75_01":"Alright, time to get to it.","pln_sh_int_76_01":"Let's do this.","pln_sh_int_77_03":"If you missed any info, just use the button to play a pre-recorded message.","pln_sh_int_77_04":"When you return next time I won't be here, but you can always press that button to play a pre-recorded message.","pln_sh_int_79_01":"Get out to the alley.","pln_sh_psp_01_01":"Try answering the phone.","pln_sh_psp_01_02":"Have you tried answering the phone?","pln_spa_01_03":"Looks like he broke free and took a gun! You gotta help him!","pln_spa_02_01":"Watch those windows, there might be snipers.","pln_spa_02_02":"Something's fishy here - I think there might be snipers in those windows.","pln_spa_02_03":"Stay sharp, guys, this whole place smells of sniper.","pln_spa_03_01":"Find the sniper and take him out before he takes the shot!","pln_spa_03_02":"Find that sniper and take him out!","pln_spa_04_02":"Take that sniper out!","pln_spa_04_03":"Get the sniper guys!","pln_spa_04_04":"Take the sniper out!","pln_spa_04_08":"Guys! The sniper! Get him!","pln_spa_05_03":"The guys in the street - take 'em out!","pln_spa_05_04":"You gotta clear the street!","pln_spa_05_06":"Take those guys in the street out!","pln_spa_05_07":"Clear the street so Charon can move!","pln_spa_06_01":"Watch out, they're deploying more snipers!","pln_spa_06_02":"Snipers! Take 'em out, gang!","pln_spa_07_03":"More snipers!","pln_spa_07_05":"They got more snipers incoming!","pln_spa_07_07":"More snipers incoming! Watch out!","pln_spa_07_08":"More snipers? These guys mean business!","pln_spa_09_01":"You really showed the NYPD how to dance. And I have a feeling they'll send more dancers.","pln_spa_09_03":"A rough day for the NYPD. And it'll get rougher - I'm sure they'll send more reinforcements.","pln_spa_10_01":"More cops are arriving!","pln_spa_10_03":"More cops incoming, guys!","pln_spa_10_04":"Damn, there are more cops incoming!","pln_spa_11_01":"You heard him guys, get going!","pln_spa_11_02":"Ok guys, go across the roof!","pln_spa_11_03":"It's the roof, guys. Get moving!","pln_spa_12_04":"Hurry up! Move to the next building.","pln_spa_12_05":"Come on guys! Move to the next building.","pln_spa_12_07":"Move into the other building. You gotta rendezvous with Charon!","pln_spa_13_02":"More snipers! Take 'em out!","pln_spa_13_03":"Snipers again! Take 'em out!","pln_spa_14_02":"That gate looks tough. See if you can find some thermite or something. You have to get that briefcase.","pln_spa_15_03":"That thermite will open the gate for you in no time. Get the briefcase!","pln_spa_16_01":"Get the briefcase! You'll need to drill the gate.","pln_spa_17_02":"Ok! Get the briefcase!","pln_spa_17_03":"Great job! Now get that briefcase!","pln_spa_18_01":"Get down that elevator shaft so you can meet up with Charon!","pln_spa_20_02":"Twitch is on his way with the van.

Should I have a bad feeling about this?","rb22_bph_intro_04c":"Did anyone remember to pack rain coats in case we need to make a raft?","rb22_des_cbf_01":"Henry's Rock. Every crackball conspiracy theory you've ever heard about classified scientific experiments and corporate occult rascality, gathered in one facility. Locke says that Murkywater's top men are up to some rather nefarious skullduggery there. Security footage we hacked shows they have two more gilded cases like the one Commissioner Garrett had in FBI lockup. One of them may even be the very same piece we recovered for the Dentist in Vegas. It isn't clear yet how they connect to Bain's search, but they're obviously important enough to the Murkies that we should probably take them off their hands, and maybe serve them a little comeuppance while we're at it.","rb22_sah_cbf_01":"OK gang, we have received a communique from the Elephant. He claims to want to help us. Seems that in the early 1900s, a Kataru member stole what he calls \"a family heirloom\". This person then bought his way onto the famous Shacklethorne expedition bound for Antarctica. His presence, according to the Elephant, doomed the voyage from the start. The familiarity of this is not a coincidence, despite the Elephant's caginess.The ship and crew were lost, until recently, when the wreckage was found crushed in the ice, far from the original planned route. A couple of miles from the wreckage, they also found a mummified corpse who looks to have died rather horrifically, and a sled along with a collection of artifacts. The items recovered are going to be auctioned in secret to a bunch of decadent society types, and the Elephant says that one of those items will help us with the device in the kitchen. I have a strange feeling about this one. It hits rather close to home.","rb22_sah_intro_01a":"More like we're heisting an HP Lovecraft novel...","rb22_sah_intro_01b":"Rats in the walls...","rb22_sah_intro_02b":"They're just trying to prove they have imaginations.","rb22_sah_intro_03a":"I could see myself living in a place like this.

You think I have forgotten how to do this?","rb4_sh11_03_03":"I see a guard up ahead.

Question is, where do I hide it?","rb4_sh11_05_02":"Jeez, don't lose your head, Bain.","rb4_sh11_05_03":"Well excuse me for not noticing it while I took down the guard.","rb4_sh11_06_01":"Good night.","rb4_sh11_06_02":"Time to sleep.","rb4_sh11_06_03":"Sleep tight.","rb4_sh11_07_02":"Shit!","rb4_sh11_07_03":"Ah shit!","rb4_sh11_08_02":"Fuck me, that was close.","rb4_sh11_08_03":"Man, that was a little too close for my taste.","rb4_sh11_09_01":"How about that shit?","rb4_sh11_09_02":"I don't even know what that is, but it should do. Right?","rb4_sh11_09_03":"That looks heavy, but it sure stands out.","rb4_sh11_10_01":"Okay, I got it. Are we done with this shit?","rb4_sh11_11_01":"I hate to admit it, but this might have been good for me actually. Two years absent in the life of crime is a long time.","rb4_sh11_11_03":"I'll be the bigger man and admit you were right, Bain. It was actually good to do this before going after more challenging heists.","rb4_sh12_01_01":"Okay, Bain.

Yeah. No, it's real quiet here.","sla_trk_ready_02":"Yeah, ready!","subtitles_0413":"OK, the airport is just down the hill. Cut through the fence and find the hangar where the truck holding the cases is. The FBI is of course, on scene. Get Vlad's guns and bring em here.","subtitles_0414":"Go in through the fence, find the guns and bring them back here. Prepare to fight and fight hard. Let's do this.","subtitles_0415":"The FBI is holding the trucks and the guns. Find the warehouse they keep the truck in. Hit the FBI hard and make it back here with the guns. Best of luck, sorry about the mess.","subtitles_0416":"OK we're good to go. I'll get you guys clear to the safe house. We have the guns to keep Vlad happy. And I'm sure it'll go over great with him. The FBI... Are another matter.","subtitles_0417":"Well executed. Guns secured and Vlad is preparing the money for us. Let's cash in.","subtitles_0418":"That was close. Good work carrying those guns up the hill. Vlad will build his army now and we will have a very fine payday indeed.","subtitles_0421-duplicate":"That worked like a charm. Well fought and well carried out if you know what I mean. Payday is coming our way, well deserved.","subtitles_0422-duplicate":"More guns, more money. Great work. Vlad will be dancing like a Russian bear, or something.","subtitles_0430":"This is still DC though, not Baltimore... So expect that you're going to get heat if you go guns blazing.","subtitles_0474":"I don't what kind of loot we're talking about so be ready for anything. Use the van to make your escape.","subtitles_0475":"Turns out the bank manager here should have kept his mouth shut - one of our guys overheard him bragging about how great the security is there, unblemished record, blah blah blah. ","subtitles_0478":"Turns out today's the day where they stockpile cash for armored truck transport to casino runs out of town. Let's roll the dice. ","subtitles_0480":"Let's go in there and take all the little square packages we can find. It will be a lot of money I'm sure. ","subtitles_0486":"The whole place is lined with safe despoit boxes. Who knows what's in there, bring a saw and start hacking.","subtitles_0487":"Got a line on some \"businessman\" who rented out a bunch of safe deposit boxes... Sounds like an opportunity too sweet to pass up, no? Let's do it. ","subtitles_0488":"Let's empty this bank out, starting with the safe deposit boxes... Lots of mysteries in there I bet...","subtitles_0492":"OK folks. Everyone ready? Let's clean the place out. ","subtitles_0493":"I know this is old history - just get those civilians on their faces and get that thermal lance burning. Go for it.","subtitles_0495":"However you guys wanna run this, you run it. It's your show, I'm on the line. Good luck.","subtitles_0497":"OK crew, that's the target. Get those people on the floor, hit those cameras, get your drill going. See you at the spot.","subtitles_0498":"Let's see what we can do here to make this thing go smooth. Run it like you know how to. Go get rich.","subtitles_0500":"Now this is no First World bank, small and compact, you should be able to do this thing in ten minutes. Just keep cool and we all win.","subtitles_0504":"Make old Bain proud. Hit this in style and keep it clean. See you at the safe house when you are done.","subtitles_0520":"...Damn it to hell they're onto us, they're onto us! You gotta escape with the loot!","subtitles_0521":"...Shit we picked up a tail folks, no shaking 'em now!","subtitles_0522":"...They tailed us from the scene, switch car failed, everyone batten down the hatches!","subtitles_0523":"...Jesus they're right on top of you, prepare to get hit!","subtitles_0524":"...Lose 'em... Lose 'em... Dammit... Dammit! You gotta stand and fight!","subtitles_0526":"...They're on us! They're on us... hang tight till I can get a backup ride...","subtitles_0527":"...Goddamn goddamn goddam police must have followed us... I'm slipping... Sorry guys... Ride's gonna get rough!","subtitles_0528":"Hell! that's half the Washington PD behind you. Dig deep folks.","subtitles_0529":"No-no-no-no-no! Ambush coming! Hang onto your loot people!","subtitles_0530":"Oh... Dammit to hell. We're busted. We're busted! Fighting time!","subtitles_0531":"Your wheelman didn't lose the tail! Goddammit!","subtitles_0533":"Ambush... Another ambush... Hang in there and eyes on the prize!","subtitles_0535":"Can't shake these cops... Gotta do this the hard way!","subtitles_0536":"We picked up a tail... Shaking him's no good... You know what comes next... Good luck!","subtitles_0701":"This is Hawkeye, I'll be there soon.","subtitles_0702":"I'm about a minute out.","subtitles_0704":"This is Hawkeye, looks real busy down there... Anyway just hang on.","subtitles_0734":"Two bags.","subtitles_0735":"Three bags.","subtitles_0738":"Six.","subtitles_0739":"Seven.","subtitles_0740":"Eight.","subtitles_0741":"That's all of 'em, you guys are hardcore.","subtitles_0770":"Guys we need to get into the warehouse and use the floodlights to signal the loot boat.","subtitles_0812":"You guys aren't exactly subtle. I'm comin'!","subtitles_0817":"OK find a way to get into that building, stay low.","subtitles_0818":"Keep an eye out for the weapon caches.","subtitles_0819":"OK you're looking for their weapon caches.","subtitles_0820":"I'm sure they're going to be well-guarded.","subtitles_0821":"If you can keep this from going loud you're probably a lot better off.","subtitles_0825":"Have a look around, I think you're close.","subtitles_0827":"Now you need to take care of it.","subtitles_0829":"Have a look around for one.","subtitles_0833":"Gonna get a little difficult from here.","subtitles_0834":"We agreed to get these damn caches for Hector.","subtitles_0836":"That's 2.","subtitles_0837":"That's 3.","subtitles_0840":"That's 6, only 2 more.","subtitles_0841":"That's 7, last one now.","subtitles_0843":"That's all of 'em, we can leave now if we want.","subtitles_0845":"There's definitely more caches around here... We could leave 'em... Or... Not.","subtitles_0848":"I hope Hector sees how committed we are. ","subtitles_0849":"You can use the \"higher-ups\" keycard to open up the doors.","subtitles_0850":"You can use the keycard to get these doors open.","subtitles_0852":"Whoa... Wait, that fence is electrified.","subtitles_0853":"That fence is electrified, if you wanna get through you'd better turn it off first.","subtitles_0856":"Locate the weapons and destroy them.","subtitles_0857":"Find the weapons and destroy them. Easy.","subtitles_0858":"Great, law enforcement - probably tailing the gangsters. Better and better.","subtitles_0859":"Great, SWAT - following the gangsters probably!","subtitles_0860":"You found a stash! Bag it up and destroy them.","subtitles_0861":"That looks like another stash. Bag it and wreck it.","subtitles_0864":"The chiefs are fleeing.","subtitles_0867":"You can use that keycard to open up the doors.","subtitles_0870":"The office will be highly guarded, so keep your eyes open for guards and cameras.","subtitles_0871":"We need to locate the position of the server room, sneak inside and disable the alarm for the door, so that we can get in unnoticed.","subtitles_0872":"So what we need to do is, locate the server room, sneak in, then disable the door alarm. After that, we roll in like the tide.","subtitles_0873":"Once inside, steal the server, and bring it to Hector.","subtitles_0877":"First thing, get inside.","subtitles_0878":"Take your time with the case.","subtitles_0879":"I'd do some casing before you go in.","subtitles_0880":"Government offices... Never good.","subtitles_0883":"Nice, pick those locks. Smart.","subtitles_0888":"Biting my nails up here folks, but so far so good.","subtitles_0889":"Close call - we're still good. ","subtitles_0892":"Beautiful, they're still in the dark.","subtitles_0893":"They don't suspect a thing, keep it going folks.","subtitles_0895":"Keep it together people.","subtitles_0899":"OK... Forget the alarm disabling... Since that was the goddamn alarm. Find the server room.","subtitles_0905":"That's the server room door alright. Inside there is what we want.","subtitles_0910":"Get the damn door open, no need to be careful.","subtitles_0915":"I'm in... Good work. Gimme a second here.","subtitles_0929":"Damn you cut the wrong wire. Next time, maybe you want to wait for me.","subtitles_0934":"Hurry up with that last door. Server's inside.","subtitles_0936":"OK...OK... Just need to get the server out of its housing and walk it to the van.","subtitles_0939":"That's it, that's it. Go. Go!","subtitles_0941":"You guys are so close. Don't get sloppy now.","subtitles_0942":"Oh... I can't... I can't even look... Come on...","subtitles_0945":"Amazing work. Gonna be some asses getting fired tomorrow.","subtitles_0947":"There goes the alarm, kick it into plan B people.","subtitles_0955":"Shit. Maybe the Feds are smartening up. The alarm triggered a security shield on the server. We gotta drill that now too.","subtitles_0959":"Just be alert with that server room door open... They'll know something up...","subtitles_0960":"Watch the server room door... If someone comes near you might need to take care of them.","subtitles_0963":"Move that server! Move it! Come on! ","subtitles_0981":"Looks like you need to learn a new trade. Hang on.","subtitles_0987":"These guys look none too organized. You will need to find the materials for the cook.","subtitles_0988":"What I can do is guide through the cook.","subtitles_0989":"Now I don't want to worry you. But if you mess up... It would be bad.","subtitles_0990":"Don't worry, I've got one of Hector's people helping.","subtitles_0992":"There's one other thing - cops will be here soon...","subtitles_0995":"People just keep doing what you're doing... Come on!","subtitles_1006":"Yeah, those are snipers!","subtitles_1009":"Thing is they have to be added in the right order...","subtitles_1013":"OK, add muriatic acid to keep the reaction going.","subtitles_1014":"Search around for the muriatic acid.","subtitles_1019":"OK great, now next step.","subtitles_1020":"You need to find caustic soda.","subtitles_1022":"These idiots must have had it here somewhere.","subtitles_1023":"The caustic soda is probably in a plastic jug with a red and blue label.","subtitles_1031":"Search around for the hydrogen chloride.","subtitles_1044":"That chopper's definitely not good at all.","subtitles_1047":"They're breaching the house!","subtitles_1057":"The information should be in a safe in one of the apartments. Keep looking!","subtitles_1066":"Ambush! Feds are moving in for the bust!","subtitles_1077":"What the fuck do you think you are doing? Kill them!","subtitles_1087":"Keep your eyes open.","subtitles_1094":"You probably want to be very careful about removing money.","subtitles_1096":"That's the bus up there.","subtitles_1098":"You might as well take that cash. My guess is they probably left a present.","subtitles_1101":"Remind me never to take a cartel job for us again...","subtitles_1105":"Chopper'll be here soon... Hang in there.","subtitles_1107":"Get those bags into the chopper.","subtitles_1110":"Yeah, I guess we got their attention, we have law enforcement on the way...","subtitles_1115":"Don't let them take out the chopper, folks... We don't want to spend more time here.","subtitles_1117":"Ready whenever you are.","subtitles_1118":"Escape is here, whenever you're ready.","subtitles_1125":"Bag it up so we can continue cooking, and get the bag to the van.","subtitles_1128":"Any luck? Keep your eyes open for anything, a sign... Something.","subtitles_1129":"Obvious, but keep a low profile. We don't need the heat.","subtitles_1130":"Probably can cut through fences...","subtitles_1131":"Lot of guards. Heads up.","subtitles_1133":"OK well you still need to figure out which one it is and get that tracker on the bottom of the truck... Or get out.","subtitles_1138":"OK OK, truck's about to leave... You better tag it if you think that's it.","subtitles_1145":"Ah... Well that's going to get everyones attention...","subtitles_1146":"They saw you. Time's of the essence now.","subtitles_1147":"Your cover's blown... Either get out or try to get a tracker on fast... Heat's coming either way.","subtitles_1148":"Well forget the quiet route...","subtitles_1149":"Highway with guns drawn in broad daylight... OK, never said it was going to be easy. Find the marked truck.","subtitles_1151":"Guns out on this one fellas. ","subtitles_1152":"Go on. Let's find the marked truck. Do it fast this is important.","subtitles_1157":"Think we got the right truck. Now go get it open.","subtitles_1161":"You find it yet? ","subtitles_1163":"Doing good... They haven't noticed anything...","subtitles_1164":"They're still in the dark, great.","subtitles_1177":"They're getting too close to the hacking device, people! Watch it.","subtitles_1178":"OK here we go.","subtitles_1182":"I wish we had some goddamn equipment that worked... Start it again.","subtitles_1186":"When you're ready hop into the van and we can roll.","subtitles_1189":"Go get the gas can from the truck and burn the truck. Make it look like an accident or something. What a mess.","subtitles_1193":"Alright it's on fire. I'd clean out the other trucks so we don't leave with nothing, if I was you.","subtitles_1198":"It's open, go get our stuff.","subtitles_1199":"Truck's open, go get what's ours out of there.","subtitles_1200":"OK, the truck's open, get our goods out.","subtitles_1202":"Now remember we're here to rob a bank - but if by accident we shoot up a ballot machine or two, them's the breaks. Understand?","subtitles_1204":"I'd look around before setting everything on fire as it were. Maybe there's a better way.","subtitles_1209":"OK that's the ticket. Get the scrambler on there. The Elephant claims this is going to win the election.","subtitles_1210":"That's the server... Get that scrambler going. We're not crooks... ","subtitles_1215":"Think it's almost there... Some kind of... It crashed.. Dammit start it up again.","subtitles_1218":"Data's scrambled. Well done. Looks like a bad header volume or something.","subtitles_1220":"Blow the wall. Collateral damage will wreck the ballot machines. We're just doing a heist, right? Oops!","subtitles_1224":"No more wall. Go on in.","subtitles_1227":"Come on, get that vault open.","subtitles_1244":"That'll keep them from seeing our business. Good.","subtitles_1247":"There are bandit barriers in the bank - you can close 'em from the security office. Will help keep cops out of your area of operation.","subtitles_1251":"Yeah, they're setting up sniper teams on the rooftops. Watch yourself.","subtitles_1252":"So far so good people.","subtitles_1253":"I love your focus... They haven't made you yet.","subtitles_1257":"Still good... Still good.","subtitles_1258":"Great thinking! The voting machines are heading for the mall in Washington, see if you can find the company that ships to that destination.","subtitles_1259":"Great that's it. Let's silently get out of here and find out if that's the right truck.","subtitles_1263":"They're going to be expecting us. These are not good people.","subtitles_1264":"Bikers inside. Guessing they're not the friendly types.","subtitles_1265":"I guess they're not very picky about quality of life...","subtitles_1268":"We just need to get this before they do. We don't want them burning information we can use.","subtitles_1272":"Must be there somewhere...","subtitles_1273":"Maybe they won't notice you... ","subtitles_1274":"Might be loose cash in there too...","subtitles_1276":"Have you found the safe yet? The address got to be in there.","subtitles_1277":"OK, that's it! Now get that thing open.","subtitles_1287":"They burned another... Come on! ","subtitles_1288":"These guys have no idea what they're messing with. Or who. ","subtitles_1297":"Crap, the cops must have gotten a call...","subtitles_1298":"Right on time... ","subtitles_1299":"Was hoping we'd do this without police for once.","subtitles_1302":"They've mined the place! Watch your step!","subtitles_1310":"Now you got us the lead we needed. Get out when you're ready.","subtitles_1311":"You think you can keep it quiet? Kudos, guys.","subtitles_1312":"Well it's on now. Deal with these meatheads. Get our stuff. Get out.","subtitles_1313":"Dammit, they're burning the intel.","subtitles_1314":"Nice place. Mr Cold Fusion's summer house. Huh.","subtitles_1316":"Funny spot to build a swingset.","subtitles_1323":"Remember you're looking for the server room.","subtitles_1324":"Find the server room fast.","subtitles_1328":"There goes the element of surprise. ","subtitles_1329":"Well now we're on their clock.","subtitles_1330":"We're gonna have to speed this up now if we want to make it...","subtitles_1335":"OK... I'm checking. Seems OK... Hmm... Seems like the power grid here keeps fluctuating... Maybe his invention...","subtitles_1337":"Be sure no one sees you hacking the server.","subtitles_1339":"Server just lost power... We need it back to continue!","subtitles_1342":"Power just went out... You need to find the circuit breaker.","subtitles_1350":"Uh... That's... More prototypes than I thought... How many is that...","subtitles_1351":"Holy... This place is bigger than we thought. You've got your work cut out for you down there.","subtitles_1352":"That... That's quite a few prototypes. We need the one that works.","subtitles_1353":"You're on your own here. Either use your head to figure out which one... Or start carrying.","subtitles_1365":"OK we're inspecting it... So far so good... He's running outputs now...","subtitles_1366":"Outputs seem clean... Couple more checks and we'll know what we got.","subtitles_1371":"Really hoping this one works out.","subtitles_1374":"No joy. Just not our day I guess. Go get another.","subtitles_1378":"No... Not this one either. The levels seemed better, too. Go get another one.","subtitles_1381":"Thank you! That's the ticket. Move out if you know what's good for you.","subtitles_1383":"We win. This is the right prototype. Get the hell out of here now.","subtitles_1391":"Great - this is it...","subtitles_1392":"OK, I'm here, get in!","subtitles_1395":"Damn it, they're burning their intel!","subtitles_1398":"If you can't figure out which is the right one just take any engine and we'll see if thats the one.","subtitles_1399":"OK, I'm coming in, get the engine ready.","subtitles_1401":"We've got the keys to his airplane, lets use it to escape!","subtitles_1402":"Nice work guys! This seems to be the right one! I'm coming back to pick you up!","subtitles_1403":"OK, I'm here, get in!","subtitles_1407":"Here we go. That tiara should be in there somewhere folks.","subtitles_1409":"Be thorough, is my advice.","subtitles_1410":"...They don't suspect anything yet.","subtitles_1411":"...You're looking good so far.","subtitles_1412":"...They don't suspect anything yet.","subtitles_1413":"...Some close calls but you are doing great...","subtitles_1419":"You want Plan B, you got it!","subtitles_1422":"The tiara has to be in there somewhere... ","subtitles_1424":"No luck yet?","subtitles_1425":"My suggestion is be a little cautious. But up to you.","subtitles_1428":"That looks like the safe... Get it open.","subtitles_1429":"Think that's the safe. Pop it.","subtitles_1430":"OK... Control the room...","subtitles_1431":"Watch the exits... No cell phones...","subtitles_1432":"Keep control...","subtitles_1433":"Cops in the back!","subtitles_1435":"They just pulled up out front! ","subtitles_1436":"Washington PD just pulled up out front!","subtitles_1438":"Still stealthy, I'll be damned.","subtitles_1451":"Watch out for cameras and metal detectors folks.","subtitles_1484":"This is a perfect heist so far folks. I wish I had filmed it.","subtitles_1486":"Hell of a job so far. Now you just need to get out.","subtitles_1496":"We want at least two bags of jewels from this store. Understand?","subtitles_1502":"Check in the back too.","subtitles_1503":"Check the back too.","subtitles_1504":"Get those bags to the car.","subtitles_1505":"Almost enough.","subtitles_1507":"That's enough for Vlad, but get more if you feel brave.","subtitles_1508":"Plenty for Vlad - is it enough for us? Your call.","subtitles_1510":"OK, so this is an easy job to get accustomed to DC.","subtitles_1511":"We're gonna take it easy on you to start. Vlad just wants you to make a statement...","subtitles_1513":"Hit the stores in here... Vlad gave us a cash target... Beyond that, it's up to you.","subtitles_1514":"Gather up... Say at least 15k and then I'll get the driver to pick you guys up. ","subtitles_1515":"Get the cash amount we agreed on and I'll send the driver. More than that is gravy.","subtitles_1517":"Sound good? Lets go!","subtitles_1528":"You gathered a bag full of stuff? Ill get a guy to come pick that up. Expect him soon.","subtitles_1533":"OK that's our guy. Get the loot into the vehicle.","subtitles_1534":"He'll leave for now, if you manage to find something else, I'll get him to return for you.","subtitles_1535":"Good. He's going to take off now if you get more I'll bring him back in.","subtitles_1539":"I'll be there in one minute.","subtitles_1540":"I'll be there in two minutes.","subtitles_1541":"Traffic's a bitch. Be there soon as I can. ","subtitles_1545":"OK, this should be entertaining. It's a nightclub hit.","subtitles_1547":"Vlad's got a little deal for us, wants us to hit this nightclub. ","subtitles_1553":"Go on in and find the office - safe should be there.","subtitles_1555":"That's the office up there. ","subtitles_1559":"Maybe there's a back way up there.","subtitles_1561":"Watch the room folks...","subtitles_1562":"OK, time to stop dancing.","subtitles_1565":"Too many dicks on the dancefloor...","subtitles_1566":"Might be more money around... You know clubs... Always something shady happening.","subtitles_1570":"Come on with the safe... This club's gonna look like Beirut in about 3 minutes.","subtitles_1572":"That's it. Beautiful. Bag it and move it.","subtitles_1573":"That's what we came for. Pack it up.","subtitles_1575":"I'm sending the van.","subtitles_1600":"Are you guys comin? Hurry!","subtitles_1602":"Security door... Huh... Someone must have a key.","subtitles_1603":"Have you found the key yet?","subtitles_1605":"So we need to send a little message here to the mall owner for Vlad.","subtitles_1608":"So. We trash the place. Do as much damage as we can.","subtitles_1610":"To show just how serious Vlad is, we're gonna destroy 50 grand worth of pretty things.","subtitles_1612":"Vlad's looking for us to destroy the requested amount. I know you're not an accountant, but you know, guess.","subtitles_1614":"Look around, I'm betting there's plenty of damage to be done. Be resourceful.","subtitles_1616":"Check closets, etc. Just do damage.","subtitles_1618":"Cops in the mall! ","subtitles_1619":"We got cops in the mall folks!","subtitles_1653":"Take out the big windows, the chopper can't drop the ladder...","subtitles_1656":"Uh, I'm gonna wait here for a couple of minutes, so hurry!","subtitles_1657":"Guys, it's getting hot! I'm out, you'll have to get out some other way!","subtitles_1658":"OK guys, I'm coming back now to pick you guys up.","subtitles_1659":"I'll be there in 3 minutes. Go down into the basement and wait for me!","subtitles_1661":"Help! They're shooting at me!","subtitles_1667":"What's the hold up, get moving before they move all the guns!","subtitles_1670":"Judging by the amount of police I'd say this is the right hangar, get working on those guns.","subtitles_1671":"Keep and eye on that control tower guys, I thought I saw some movement up there.","subtitles_1673":"Better get moving boys, the longer it takes the more cops are going to show up!","subtitles_1674":"Good start, now get the rest!","subtitles_1676":"That's the last one, well done. I'll leave it up to you boys if you want to get more bags or pull out.","subtitles_1679":"OK, you guys totally emptied that hangar, time to get out of here.","subtitles_1680":"Well done guys.","subtitles_1740":"It's open! Bag the gold!","subtitles_1741":"It's open! Search through the deposit boxes!","subtitles_1747":"OK. Time to burn some money.","subtitles_1748":"OK folks, we're going in and looking for the vault. Cartel or not it's still a bank, right?","subtitles_1749":"I dunno... There's some weird... It's probably nothing. ","subtitles_1750":"I keep losing my com connection. Strange.","subtitles_1754":"Goddamn cartel! They electrified the goddamn vault. ","subtitles_1755":"Well that's a wrinkle. They're running current through the vault!","subtitles_1759":"These cartel guys aren't taking any chances, they wired up the door with electricity. ","subtitles_1761":"OK, power's down. No more shocks. I hope.","subtitles_1762":"Sorry about that, I should have known the com problems were not normal.
